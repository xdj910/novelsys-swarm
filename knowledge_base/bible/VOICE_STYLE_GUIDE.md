### Sample Voice Applications

#### Opening Scene Sample
"The morning the coral started dying, nobody thought much about it at first. Here in Paradise Cove, we've grown accustomed to the sea's moods - the way she throws her tantrums during hurricane season, then settles into that peaceful turquoise that brings the tourists flocking. But when old Manny pulled up his fishing nets and found them empty for the third day running, that's when we started paying attention. I was sitting on my verandah with my morning coffee, watching the pelicans dive for breakfast, when I noticed they were coming up empty-beaked too. Something was wrong in our little piece of heaven, and as I'd learn soon enough, it wasn't just the fish that were in trouble."

#### Community Investigation Sample
"The thing about living on an island is that secrets have nowhere to hide. They float around like coconuts after a storm, bumping into each other until somebody picks them up. That's how I found myself in Miss Carmen's kitchen that Thursday morning, pretending to borrow sugar while really wanting to know why she'd been seen arguing with Dr. Martinez at the marina. 'That man,' she said, settling her ample frame into her favorite chair, 'thinks he can come here with his fancy equipment and tell us what's wrong with our reef. Been diving these waters since before he was born.' She poured me coffee without asking - island hospitality never waits for invitations."

#### Environmental Discovery Sample
"The water sample Dr. Martinez had been studying sat in its little vial on the lab bench, looking innocent enough. Clear as gin, my grandmother would have said, though she'd probably have added something about still waters running deep. I held it up to the morning light streaming through the jalousie windows, trying to see what had made him so agitated that last night anyone saw him alive. The reef survey reports were spread across his desk like pieces of a puzzle - temperature readings, pH levels, species counts that told the story of our dying ocean in clinical numbers."
