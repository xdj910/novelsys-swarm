Here in Paradise Cove, we've grown accustomed to the sea's moods - the way she throws her tantrums during hurricane season, then settles into that peaceful turquoise that brings the tourists flocking. But when old Manny pulled up his fishing nets and found them empty for the third day running, that's when we started paying attention. I was sitting on my verandah with my morning coffee, watching the pelicans dive for breakfast, when I noticed they were coming up empty-beaked too. Something was wrong in our little piece of heaven, and as I'd learn soon enough, it wasn't just the fish that were in trouble. The body we found floating among the dead coral three days later would change everything we thought we knew about our sleepy island community."

That's how I found myself in Miss Carmen's kitchen that Thursday morning, pretending to borrow sugar while really wanting to know why she'd been seen arguing with Dr. Martinez at the marina. 'That man,' she said, settling her ample frame into her favorite chair, 'thinks he can come here with his fancy equipment and tell us what's wrong with our reef. Been diving these waters since before he was born.' She poured me coffee without asking - island hospitality never waits for invitations. 'But I tell you something strange, child. Yesterday I saw him throwing something over the side of his boat. Something that sank like a stone.' Outside, the trade winds rustled through her frangipani tree, and I could smell the baking bread from the hotel kitchen. Paradise, except for the small matter of environmental disaster and possible murder."

Clear as gin, my grandmother would have said, though she'd probably have added something about still waters running deep. I held it up to the morning light streaming through the jalousie windows, trying to see what had made him so agitated that last night anyone saw him alive. The reef survey reports were spread across his desk like pieces of a puzzle - temperature readings, pH levels, species counts that told the story of our dying ocean in clinical numbers. But it was the notebook margin note that made my breath catch: 'Impossible concentrations. Someone is doing this deliberately.' Outside, the hermit crabs were making their morning migration across the beach, and the hotel guests were starting their usual breakfast chatter. Normal island life continuing while our underwater world was being systematically destroyed. The question was whether Dr. Martinez had been killed for discovering who was behind it, or if he'd been silenced before he could reveal something even worse."

Instead of discussing the annual festival or the new parking regulations for dive boats, we were facing the truth about who'd been poisoning our reef. The community center was packed, everyone from the hotel staff to the fishing families squeezed into plastic chairs, electric fans stirring the humid air that carried the scent of frangipani and uncertainty. When Minister Thompson stood up to speak, his usually steady voice wavered like heat shimmer over hot sand. 'We trusted him with our children's future,' he said, gesturing toward the empty chair where our former marine park director should have been sitting. 'But greed made him forget that some things can't be replaced with money.' The evidence was spread before us - the illegal dumping permits, the falsified water quality reports, the payments from the mainland development company. Our paradise hadn't been killed by strangers, but by one of our own who'd forgotten that island time means thinking in generations, not quarterly profits."

For most people, that's just a number, but when you've spent fifteen years studying Caribbean reef systems, you know it means the ocean is becoming more acidic, and our coral can't survive much more of this chemical assault. I tucked the tablet into my waterproof case and surfaced, pulling off my diving mask to find my research assistant Maria treading water beside me with that concerned expression I'd been seeing too often lately. 'How bad?' she asked in rapid Spanish before switching back to English for the benefit of the dive boat captain. Growing up in San Juan before earning my PhD at Woods Hole, I'd learned to navigate between languages the same way I now moved between the scientific community and the island families who depended on these reefs for their livelihoods. But today's readings suggested someone was doing more than climate change to kill our coral, and that meant this had moved beyond environmental science into something that required different expertise entirely."

'Think of it like this,' I said, gesturing to the simple diagram I'd drawn. 'When the ocean absorbs too much carbon dioxide, it becomes like vinegar. And you know what vinegar does to shells.' Old Captain Rodriguez nodded slowly from the front row. He'd been diving these waters for forty years, long enough to remember when the coral heads were twice their current size. 'But Doctor Elena,' he said, using the respectful title that still made me think of my grandmother's pride when I graduated, 'this happened too fast for just climate. Someone been dumping something, verdad?' His weathered hands sketched the shape of the reef he knew by heart. 'The water, she taste different now. Bitter.' That was when I realized I wasn't just dealing with environmental degradation - I was looking at deliberate poisoning."

Twenty-three years I'd been coming to these islands, first as my father's daughter learning to snorkel in the shallows, then as an undergraduate research student, and finally as Dr. Elena Vasquez, marine chemist and apparently now amateur detective. The samples I'd collected from the reef system told a story of systematic contamination that started precisely six months ago, coinciding with the new desalination plant's construction. But the plant's environmental impact statement claimed they were using reverse osmosis, not the industrial chemicals showing up in my analysis. Someone had been lying, and given that three people associated with the environmental review were now dead, it seemed they were willing to kill to keep lying."

The slides I'd prepared showed the contamination timeline, the mortality data, the chemical signatures that pointed directly to illegal dumping from the desalination facility. 'These compounds don't occur naturally in seawater,' I explained, keeping my voice steady despite knowing that plant manager Richard Sterling was sitting in the back row with his lawyer. 'The isotope ratios prove they came from industrial processes, specifically the type used in older desalination systems that dump heavy metal brine instead of treating it properly.' When Sterling stood up to object, claiming the plant met all environmental standards, I clicked to my final slide - the falsified EPA reports with his signature, alongside the real data I'd been collecting for six months. 'The question isn't whether you've been poisoning our waters, Mr. Sterling. The question is whether you killed Dr. Martinez and the others to keep them from proving it.'"

So when that marine biologist checked in last Tuesday with his expensive equipment and nervous energy, I knew he wasn't here for our famous conch fritters or the sunset view from the gallery. Dr. Philip Chen kept looking over his shoulder like he expected trouble to follow him, and sure enough, by Thursday morning he was floating face-down in the harbor with the morning's catch. Now, most innkeepers might leave such business to the authorities, but when someone dies in your small community, especially someone who'd been asking pointed questions about the new resort's construction, well, you can't help but take it personally. Forty-three rooms I've filled over the years with honeymooners and bird watchers and the occasional mystery writer, but I've never had a guest murdered before. It's bad for business, certainly, but more than that - it's wrong. And when something's wrong in my little corner of paradise, I've found it's best to set it right myself."

That's why I invited half the village for Sunday dinner on the gallery, with my famous curry goat and rice and peas, the ceiling fans stirring the trade winds and the bougainvillea blooming purple against the white railings. Nothing loosens tongues like good food and the feeling that you're among family. Young Marcus from the dive shop was picking at his plantains, still shaken from finding Dr. Chen's body. 'The thing is, Miss Paulette,' he said, using the respectful address his mother taught him, 'that man been diving the same spot every morning for a week. Right where they blasting for the new resort foundation.' I passed around the sweet potato pudding and let the conversation flow like island time - patient, meandering, but always moving toward truth. By the time we finished coffee, I knew three important things: Dr. Chen had been collecting water samples, the construction company had been working nights without permits, and someone had seen lights on at the marina office well past midnight the night before his death."

The reef used to stretch so far out you could walk to it at low tide, careful stepping on the coral heads that rose like underwater gardens. Now the bleaching has crept in closer each year, white patches like old bones scattered through what used to be rainbow colors. My late husband used to say the sea was trying to tell us something with all this dying, but we weren't listening hard enough. That's why when I found Dr. Chen's research notes in his room - the ones the police missed - I understood why someone might kill to keep them quiet. Water temperature records going back twenty years, acidity measurements that told the story of slow poisoning, and photographs documenting coral death that coincided exactly with each phase of resort development. The ocean was screaming, and Dr. Chen had been the only one fluent enough in her language to translate the warning."

I stood at the podium with Dr. Chen's research spread before me, feeling the weight of every year I'd spent caring for this place and its people. 'Cornelius Blackwood has been lying to us,' I said, my voice carrying the authority of someone who'd fed half these people as children and comforted the other half through hard times. 'His construction company has been dumping chemicals in our harbor, killing our reef, and now they've killed a good man to keep their secret.' The evidence was all there - falsified environmental reports, illegal dumping schedules, and the payoffs that had bought silence from officials who should have protected us. When Blackwood stood up to deny it all, claiming I was just a crazy old woman with too much imagination, I smiled the same smile I'd used on difficult guests for thirty-seven years. 'Mr. Blackwood,' I said sweetly, 'I may be old, but I'm not blind. And neither is the FBI agent who's been staying in room twelve under the name Johnson.'"
