- Tool configurations are 100% correct (Read, Write, Grep)
- Issue is content/language level, not tool configuration

### Agents (10 estimated)
**Clean agents** with clear single-task execution and minimal ambiguity:
- Likely test agents with simple single-purpose operations
- Utility agents with clear atomic operations
- Status/report agents with pure data operations

## Root Cause: Template Propagation

**Primary Source**: TEMPLATE_agent.md historical "Step 1/2/3" pattern
**Impact**: 21+ agents created from template inherit execution ambiguity
**Secondary Source**: Unclear role boundaries in coordinator documentation
**Result**: Systematic replication across 88% of system

## Remediation Priority

### Phase 1: CRITICAL (23 components)
- **Coordinators** (8) - Highest priority, architectural violations
- **Commands** (6) - High priority, delegation boundary issues
- **Agents** (9) - High priority, multi-step execution confusion

### Phase 2: MAJOR (34 components)
- Significant execution ambiguity requiring clarification

### Phase 3: MINOR (28 components)
- Occasional language improvements

### Phase 4: Validation
- Ensure CLEAN components remain clean
- Create validation checklist for new components
