- ✅ Architecture is 100% compliant with CLAUDE.md standards
- ✅ No recursion risks (zero Task tools in subagents)
- ✅ Complete 3-folder user materials integration implemented
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Documentation is comprehensive and consistent
- ⚠️ Actual folder structure pending workflow execution
- ⚠️ User materials integration untested in production

### 3-Folder Structure Implementation Status

**✅ CORRECTLY CONFIGURED** - Ready for execution:
- `user_materials/` folders exist with proper README.md files
- `processed/` and `agent_outputs/` folders will be created during workflow execution
- Article initiator agent properly configured to create all three folders
- Documentation correctly reflects new structure

**Missing Implementation**: The `processed/` and `agent_outputs/` folders don't exist yet because:
1. Articles are in "initialized" status - haven't started research phase
2. Folders are created dynamically during workflow execution
3. This is expected behavior per architecture design
