## 1. System Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Five-Layer Architecture Implementation

```yaml
Layer 1: Commands Layer
  Primary: t1-ttd-article
  Purpose: User interface and workflow initiation
  Constraints: <100 lines, pure delegation pattern

Layer 2: Main Claude Layer
  Role: Central orchestrator with Task tool
  Responsibilities:
    - Parse user inspiration
    - Coordinate multi-phase workflow
    - Handle all human interaction (NO agent-human direct interaction)
    - Execute parallel agent scheduling
    - Automatic status updates throughout workflow

Layer 3: Coordinators Layer
  Components: 4 specialized coordinators
  Tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep (NO Task tool)
  Output: JSON execution plans only

Layer 4: Agents Layer
  Components: 25+ specialized agents + 2 NEW status agents
  Tools: Task-specific (NO Task tool)
  Communication: File system only
  Human Interaction: NONE - agents only return data to Main Claude

Layer 5: Data/File System Layer
  Purpose: State management and recursion prevention
  Structure: Hierarchical workspace organization + status tracking
```

### 1.2 Core Workflow Integration

```yaml
Phase 1: Interactive Topic Exploration

  Iterations: 3-5 rounds with quality gates
  Output: refined article with quality certification
  Status Updates: 15-25 automatic status updates (5 per round)
  Human Interaction: Checkpoints handled by Main Claude only

Phase 3: Final Production
  Duration: 3-5 minutes
  Output: Multi-platform adapted content
  Status Updates: 3 automatic registry updates + completion
  Human Interaction: Final approval via Main Claude
```

## 2. Status Management Components

### 2.1 New Status Management Agents

#### t1-registry-updater
```yaml
---
name: t1-registry-updater
description: Updates T1-TTD registry during phase transitions and iteration progress
tools: Read, Write
model: claude-haiku-3-5-20241022
thinking: |
  Specialized version of art-registry-updater for T1-TTD workflow.
  Handles unique T1-TTD states: iteration rounds, quality gates, checkpoint detection.
---

## Input/Output Specification

### Input Requirements
Prompt from Main Claude:
- T1-TTD article directory path
- Update context (phase_completion, iteration_round, quality_gate, checkpoint_detection)
- Quality metrics and iteration data when applicable
- Checkpoint detection results when applicable

### File I/O Operations
Reads from:
- `.claude/t1-registry/registry.json` - Current T1-TTD registry state
- `{article_path}/metadata.json` - T1-TTD article metadata with iteration tracking

Writes to:
- `.claude/t1-registry/registry.json.tmp` - Updated registry (atomic write)

### Output Format
Returns to Main Claude:
- Success confirmation with T1-TTD specific update summary
- Registry state changes applied (iteration tracking, quality progression)
- Error details if updates fail

## T1-TTD Registry Update Logic

Handle T1-TTD specific status updates:

### Phase Completion Updates
Standard phase progression with T1-TTD enhancement:
- Phase 1: topic_exploration -> ttd_iterative_creation
- Phase 2: iteration_active -> final_production (or early_completion)
- Phase 3: final_production -> published

### Iteration Round Updates (NEW)
Track TTD-DR iteration progress:
```json
"current_work": {
  "article_id": "t1_20250924_145612_ai_medical_risks",
  "workflow_type": "t1-ttd",
  "status": "iteration_active",
  "current_round": 3,
  "quality_scores": {"accuracy": 0.85, "insight": 0.83, "originality": 0.85},
  "gate_decision": "continue",
  "estimated_completion": "2025-09-24T15:45:00Z"
}
```

### Quality Gate Updates (NEW)
Update based on gate decisions:
- continue -> increment round, update quality scores
- early_completion -> move to final_production
- checkpoint_detected -> set sub_status = "checkpoint_data_available"

### Checkpoint Detection Updates (CORRECTED)
Track checkpoint detection activity:
- checkpoint_detected -> log in detection_history
- checkpoint_data_prepared -> update data availability
- checkpoint_resolution -> record outcome via Main Claude

### T1-TTD Statistics Updates (NEW)
Maintain T1-TTD specific metrics:
```json
"t1_ttd_statistics": {
  "total_articles": 3,
  "average_rounds": 3.5,
  "quality_achievements": {"tier_a_articles": 2},
  "human_collaboration": {"average_checkpoints": 2.3}
}
```
```

#### t1-status-tracker
```yaml
---
name: t1-status-tracker
description: Validates and tracks T1-TTD status transitions and quality progression
tools: Read, Write
thinking: |
  Ensures status consistency across metadata and registry.
  Validates state transitions and detects anomalies.
---

## Input/Output Specification

### Input Requirements
Prompt from Main Claude:
- Current article path for status validation
- Expected state transition context
- Quality progression data for validation

### File I/O Operations
Reads from:
- `{article_path}/metadata.json` - Article metadata
- `.claude/t1-registry/registry.json` - Registry state
- `{article_path}/status/status_history.json` - Historical progression

Writes to:
- `{article_path}/status/status_history.json` - Status transition log
- `{article_path}/status/quality_progression.json` - Quality tracking

### Output Format
Returns to Main Claude:
- Status validation results
- Quality progression analysis
- Recovery recommendations if inconsistencies found

## Status Validation Logic

### State Transition Validation
Verify valid T1-TTD state transitions:
- Phase progression follows defined sequence
- Iteration rounds increment correctly
- Quality gates trigger appropriately
- Checkpoint detection follows proper pattern

### Quality Progression Tracking
Monitor three-dimensional quality evolution:
- Accuracy tier progression (D->C->B->A)
- Insight depth evolution (1->2->3->4)
- Originality score improvements (0.8->0.6->0.4)

### Consistency Checking
Ensure metadata and registry alignment:
- Current work status matches metadata phase
- Quality scores consistent between sources
- Checkpoint detection counts accurate

Execute validation and update status tracking files.
```

### 2.2 File Structure Enhancements

```yaml
T1-TTD Status Management Structure:

.claude/
  t1-registry/
    - registry.json (T1-TTD enhanced registry)
    - performance_analytics.json

## 12. Conclusion

This comprehensive implementation plan provides a complete blueprint for building the T1-TTD system with bulletproof status management integration and corrected human collaboration patterns following proper Claude Code architecture. The enhanced architecture ensures:

1. **Theoretical Fidelity + Status Reliability**: All TTD-DR mechanisms faithfully implemented with comprehensive status tracking
2. **Production Readiness + Status Resilience**: Robust error handling, performance optimization, and status-based recovery
3. **Quality Assurance + Quality Transparency**: Three-dimensional quality framework with complete quality progression visibility
4. **User Experience + Progress Visibility**: Streamlined workflows with real-time status and predictive completion
5. **Scalability + Status Scalability**: Modular design supporting future enhancements with scalable status management
6. **Architectural Compliance**: Proper Claude Code patterns with corrected human collaboration architecture

### Key Status Management Innovations:

- **Automatic Status Updates**: Zero-intervention status tracking throughout the workflow
- **Three-Dimensional Quality Progression**: Real-time visibility into accuracy, insight, and originality evolution
- **Checkpoint Detection**: Agents detect conditions and return data to Main Claude for human interaction
- **Predictive Completion**: Accurate time and quality estimates based on current progress
- **Bulletproof Recovery**: 100% reliable recovery from any interruption point
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Full transparency of all workflow decisions and quality improvements

### Key Human Collaboration Corrections:

- **Proper Architecture**: Agents detect checkpoints and return data, never interact directly with humans
- **Main Claude Orchestration**: ALL human interaction handled by Main Claude exclusively
- **Simple Decision Format**: Numerical choices (1/2/3) for user-friendly interaction
- **Complete Status Integration**: Checkpoint detection and resolution fully tracked
- **Zero Recursion Risk**: Agents never call other agents, eliminating architectural violations

The system represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted content creation, combining the rigor of academic research methodologies with practical production needs, enterprise-grade status management, and proper Claude Code architectural patterns.

**Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 implementation with core architecture and status infrastructure development, followed by iterative testing and refinement of both the quality assessment system, comprehensive status management, and corrected human collaboration patterns.
