## 1. Core Concepts

### 1.1 TTD-DR Core Ideas
- **Iterative Draft Optimization**: Not linear writing, but continuous iterative improvement
- **Verification-Driven Research**: Each research targets specific gaps with verification mechanisms
- **Self-Evolution**: Each component continuously optimizes its output quality

### 1.2 Our Unique Value
- **Author Voice**: Maintaining consistent personal style
- **Content Strategy**: Clear positioning and direction
- **Interactive Decision**: User-led topic selection
- **Quality Assurance**: Three-dimensional quality assessment system (Accuracy, Insight, Originality)

## 2. Status Management Architecture

### 2.1 T1-TTD State Machine

Based on proven article system patterns, the T1-TTD workflow uses a comprehensive state machine with:

```yaml
T1-TTD Phase States:
  Phase 0: system_configured (one-time setup)
  Phase 1: inspiration_parsed → topic_explored → topic_confirmed
  Phase 2: draft_initialized → iteration_active → quality_gates_passed
  Phase 3: final_audit_complete → human_approved → published

Iteration Sub-States (Phase 2 Detail):
  Round 1-5: variant_generation → research_active → denoising_active →
             quality_assessment → crossover_optimization → gate_decision

Quality Checkpoint States:
  checkpoint_alpha: accuracy_verification_required
  checkpoint_beta: insight_enhancement_required
  checkpoint_gamma: originality_adjustment_required

Human Collaboration States (CORRECTED):
  checkpoint_detected → data_returned_to_main_claude →
  human_interaction_via_main_claude → decision_processed → workflow_continues
```

### 2.4 Automatic Status Updates

Following the proven pattern from the article system, T1-TTD includes automatic status updates:

```yaml
Status Update Triggers:

Phase 1 Completion:
  Event: Topic confirmed by user
  Update: phase_status.current_phase = 2, topic_exploration.status = "completed"
  Registry: current_work.status = "ttd_draft_initialization"

Iteration Round Start:
  Event: New TTD-DR round begins
  Update: ttd_iteration_tracking.current_round++, current_round_status reset
  Registry: current_work.sub_status = "variant_generation"

Quality Gate Decision:
  Event: Gate decision made (continue/complete/human_intervention)
  Update: gate_decision logged, quality_progression updated
  Registry: current_work.sub_status = gate_decision result

Human Checkpoint Detection:
  Event: Quality threshold breached (detected by agent)
  Update: human_collaboration.checkpoints_detected++
  Registry: current_work.sub_status = "checkpoint_data_available"

Self-Evolution Complete:
  Event: Agent evolution converges
  Update: self_evolution_tracking updated with results
  Registry: No change (internal optimization)

Article Complete:
  Event: Final production complete
  Update: phase_status.current_phase = 3, status = "published"
  Registry: Clear current_work, increment statistics
```

## 3. Complete Workflow Design

### Phase 0: Basic Setup (One-time Configuration)

```yaml
Author Profile Setup:
  execution_timing: One-time completion during system initialization
  content_includes:
    - author_profile.yaml (author voice signature)
    - content_strategy.yaml (content strategy)
    - writing_style.yaml (writing style)
  reuse_method: Shared across all article creation

  status_tracking:
    registry_field: "system_configuration.t1_profiles_configured"
    metadata_impact: Enables T1-TTD workflow availability
```

### Phase 1: Interactive Topic Exploration

```yaml
Step 1.1: Inspiration Capture
  user_input:
    type: Any format
    examples:
      - "Saw a paper..."
      - "Discussion on Twitter..."
      - "Sudden idea..."
      - PDF file path
      - URL link

  system_processing:
    - t1-inspiration-parser: Parse user intent
    - t1-topic-explorer: Quick background research
    output: inspiration_context.json

  status_updates:
    metadata: phase_status.status = "inspiration_parsed"
    registry: current_work.sub_status = "topic_exploration"

Step 1.2: Exploratory Research
  execution_content:
    - Market scan: Current status of related content
    - Trend analysis: Topic popularity trends
    - Gap identification: Uncovered perspectives
    - Competitor analysis: Existing content quality
  output: exploration_report.md

  status_updates:
    metadata: phase_status.status = "topic_explored"
    registry: current_work.sub_status = "topic_selection"

Step 1.3: Topic Suggestions
  generation_method:
    - Generate 3-5 directions based on content strategy
    - Each direction includes:
      * Title suggestions
      * Core perspective
      * Market gap level (1-5 stars)
      * Strategy match rate (percentage)
      * Estimated impact (1-5 stars)

  interactive_display:
    ```
    Based on your idea and our content strategy, suggest the following directions:

    1. [Technical Depth] "Title A"
       - Gap level: [x][x][x][x][ ]
       - Match rate: 85%
       - Impact: [x][x][x][x][ ]

    2. [Business Insight] "Title B"
       - Gap level: [x][x][x][ ][ ]
       - Match rate: 92%
       - Impact: [x][x][x][x][x]

    3. [Trend Foresight] "Title C"
       - Gap level: [x][x][x][x][x]
       - Match rate: 78%
       - Impact: [x][x][x][ ][ ]

    Please select direction (1-3) or input 'more' to explore more
    ```

Step 1.4: User Decision
  interaction_loop:
    - Select suggestion -> Enter refinement
    - Request more -> Generate new suggestions
    - Customize -> Accept user input
    - Combine -> Merge multiple directions

Step 1.5: Topic Confirmation
  refinement_content:
    - Precise title
    - Core arguments (3-5)
    - Target readers
    - Expected word count
    - Key value

  final_confirmation:
    "Confirm this topic direction? [Y/n/modify]"

  output:
    confirmed_topic.yaml

  status_updates:
    metadata:
      - phase_status.current_phase = 2
      - topic_exploration.status = "completed"
      - topic_exploration.user_selection logged
    registry:
      - current_work.phase = "ttd_iterative_creation"
      - current_work.status = "draft_initialization"
```

### Phase 2: TTD-DR Iterative Creation

```yaml
Step 2.1: Research Plan Generation
  input:
    - confirmed_topic.yaml
    - author_profile.yaml
    - content_strategy.yaml

  processing:
    - t1-research-planner: Generate structured research plan
    - Determine key areas to explore
    - Set information acquisition priorities

  output:
    research_plan.yaml
    contains:
      - Key research questions (5-8)
      - Information source priorities
      - Expected depth levels

  status_updates:
    metadata: ttd_iteration_tracking.current_round = 1
    registry: current_work.sub_status = "draft_generation"

Step 2.2: Noisy Draft Generation (Truly Noisy Draft)
  purpose: Generate intentionally rough starting point, simulating true "noise signal"

  input:
    - research_plan.yaml
    - author_profile.yaml
    - Basic knowledge (LLM internal)

  processing:
    - t1-noisy-draft-generator: Generate high-noise initial draft
    - Content composition:
      * 50% outline/bullet points (structural skeleton)
      * 30% [PLACEHOLDER: Need specific data]
      * 15% [TENTATIVE: Statements to be verified]
      * 5% Definitive content (core definitions only)
    - Extensive use of uncertainty markers:
      * [needs verification]
      * [data to be supplemented]
      * [viewpoint needs support]
      * [possibly... but needs confirmation]

  output:
    draft_v0_noisy.md
    metadata:
      - structure_completeness: 20-30%
      - content_certainty: 5-10%
      - placeholder_count: 50+
      - noise_level: 85-90%

  status_updates:
    metadata: ttd_iteration_tracking.current_round_status.status = "draft_initialized"
    registry: current_work.sub_status = "iteration_active"

Step 2.3: Parallel Denoising Iteration (Parallel Denoising with Variants)

  For Round N (1 to 5):

    Step 2.3.1: Parallel Variant Generation (3 different optimization directions)
      input: draft_v{n-1}.md (or initial noisy draft)

      Create 3 variants in parallel:
        Variant A: Data-driven direction (focus on facts and statistics)
        Variant B: Narrative-driven direction (focus on storytelling and flow)
        Variant C: Argument-driven direction (focus on logic and argumentation)

      Each variant independently performs:
        - Noise identification (own optimization focus)
        - Gap analysis (from own perspective)
        - Research question generation (different targets)

      output:
        - draft_v{n}_variant_a.md
        - draft_v{n}_variant_b.md
        - draft_v{n}_variant_c.md

      status_updates:
        metadata:
          - current_round_status.variants_generated = ["A", "B", "C"]
          - current_round_status.status = "research_active"

    Step 2.3.2: Self-Evolution Research (Required, not optional)
      Each variant's research component defaults to self-evolution:

        a) Question generation self-evolution
          For each variant:
            - Generate 5 different angle question sets
            - Evaluate information value of each question set
            - Select top-2 to continue

        b) Answer synthesis self-evolution
          For each search result:
            - Try 3 different synthesis strategies
            - Evaluate information density and relevance
            - Select optimal strategy output

        c) Verification path self-evolution
          - Multi-source cross-verification
          - Dynamic confidence adjustment
          - Conflicting information annotation

      output:
        Each variant has its own research results:
        - research_v{n}_variant_[a/b/c].md
        - verified_facts_v{n}_variant_[a/b/c].json

      status_updates:
        metadata:
          - current_round_status.research_complete = true
          - self_evolution_tracking updated for active agents

    Step 2.3.3: Parallel Variant Denoising (Parallel Variant Denoising)
      Each variant independently performs denoising optimization:

      Variant A (Data-driven):
        Focus: Replace [PLACEHOLDER] with specific data
        - Search for accurate statistical numbers
        - Add chart data support
        - Verify all numerical accuracy

      Variant B (Narrative-driven):
        Focus: Improve story fluency and attractiveness
        - Expand bullet points into paragraphs
        - Add transitions and connectives
        - Optimize opening and ending impact

      Variant C (Argument-driven):
        Focus: Strengthen logical chains
        - Convert [TENTATIVE] to definitive statements
        - Supplement causal relationships
        - Add rebuttals and balanced viewpoints

      output:
        - refined_v{n}_variant_a.md (data-rich version)
        - refined_v{n}_variant_b.md (narrative-smooth version)
        - refined_v{n}_variant_c.md (argument-rigorous version)

      status_updates:
        metadata: current_round_status.denoising_complete = true

    Step 2.3.4: Three-Dimensional Quality Assessment (New Quality Framework)
      Quality detection for each variant:

      Accuracy Assessment:
        input: refined_v{n}_variant_[a/b/c].md
        processing:
          - t1-accuracy-evaluator: Statement extraction and classification
          - High-priority statement marking (needs manual verification)
          - Contextual consistency check
          - Transparency grading (Tier A/B/C/D)
        output:
          - accuracy_report_v{n}_variant_[a/b/c].json
          - verification_needed_v{n}_variant_[a/b/c].json

      Insight Assessment:
        input: refined_v{n}_variant_[a/b/c].md
        processing:
          - t1-insight-evaluator: Connectivity calculation
          - Depth level analysis
          - Surprise factor assessment
          - Insight grading (Tier S/A/B/C)
        output:
          - insight_report_v{n}_variant_[a/b/c].json
          - insight_enhancement_suggestions_v{n}.json

      Originality Detection:
        input: refined_v{n}_variant_[a/b/c].md
        processing:
          - t1-originality-detector: Semantic similarity analysis
          - Structural pattern detection
          - Concept combination novelty assessment
          - Originality grading (Tier S/A/B/C/D)
        output:
          - originality_report_v{n}_variant_[a/b/c].json
          - similarity_alerts_v{n}.json

      status_updates:
        metadata:
          - current_round_status.quality_scores updated for each variant
          - quality_progression.round_history updated

    Step 2.3.5: Quality-Oriented Cross-over Fusion (Improved Version)
      input: 3 variants + 3x3 quality reports

      Enhanced Merging Strategy:
        Phase 1: Quality weight calculation
          for each variant:
            quality_weight = {
              "accuracy": accuracy_report["tier_score"],
              "insight": insight_report["tier_score"],
              "originality": originality_report["tier_score"]
            }
            overall_quality = weighted_average(quality_weight)

        Phase 2: Paragraph-level smart selection
          for each paragraph:
            selection_criteria:
              1. Highest accuracy factual statements
              2. Deepest insight analysis parts
              3. Most original viewpoint expressions
              4. Highest overall quality score paragraphs

        Phase 3: Quality conflict resolution
          if accuracy_conflict:
            mark [FACT_CONFLICT: needs manual verification]
          if insight_conflict:
            fuse multi-angle viewpoints, annotate sources
          if originality_conflict:

## 4. Status Integration Points

### 4.1 Automatic Status Updates

```yaml
Registry Update Pattern (Following Proven Article System):

After Phase Completion:
  Trigger: Automatic after each major phase
  Agent: t1-registry-updater
  Data: Article path + phase context + quality metrics
  Required: True (built into workflow)

After Iteration Round:
  Trigger: After each TTD-DR round completes
  Agent: t1-registry-updater
  Data: Round number + quality scores + gate decision
  Required: True (prevents drift)

After Quality Gate:
  Trigger: After gate decision (continue/complete/checkpoint)
  Agent: t1-registry-updater
  Data: Gate decision + quality thresholds + next action
  Required: True (maintains consistency)

After Checkpoint Detection:
  Trigger: After agent detects checkpoint condition and returns data
  Agent: t1-registry-updater
  Data: Checkpoint type + detection context + recommendations
  Required: True (tracks detection events)
```

### 4.2 State Transitions

```yaml
Valid State Transitions:

Phase 1:
  inspiration_parsed → topic_explored → topic_confirmed

Phase 2 (Iteration Loop):
  draft_initialized →
    [for each round 1-5]:
      variant_generation → research_active → denoising_active →
      quality_assessment → crossover_optimization → gate_decision →
        [continue to next round OR complete OR checkpoint_detected]

Phase 3:
  final_audit_complete → human_approved → published

Error/Interrupt States:
  Any state → system_error (with recovery path)
  Any state → user_cancelled (with cleanup)
  quality_assessment → checkpoint_detected → checkpoint_data_returned → continue

Human Collaboration States (CORRECTED):
  checkpoint_detected → data_returned_to_main_claude →
  main_claude_displays_checkpoint → user_provides_input →
  main_claude_processes_decision → workflow_continues
```

### 4.3 Three-Dimensional Quality Progression

```yaml
Quality State Tracking:

Accuracy Tier Progression:
  Round 1: D tier (insufficient) → C tier (basic)
  Round 2: C tier (basic) → B tier (good)
  Round 3: B tier (good) → A tier (excellent)
  Target: A tier (80+ score) for publication

Insight Depth Evolution:
  Level 1: Surface (information restatement)
  Level 2: Analytical (cause-effect analysis)
  Level 3: Synthetic (multi-perspective integration)
  Level 4: Meta (assumption questioning)
  Target: Level 3+ for publication

Originality Score Improvements:
  Round 1: 0.8 similarity (high overlap with existing)
  Round 2: 0.6 similarity (moderate uniqueness)
  Round 3: 0.4 similarity (high originality)
  Target: <0.5 similarity score for publication

Quality Convergence Detection:
  Early Exit: All dimensions reach Tier A (85+ scores)
  Checkpoint Detection: Any dimension below Tier C (60 scores)
  Continue: Improving trend with iterations remaining
  Complete: Maximum rounds reached with acceptable quality
