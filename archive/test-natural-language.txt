=== NATURAL LANGUAGE PATTERN TESTING ===
Test Time: Thu, Sep 11, 2025 10:42:09 PM

COORDINATOR PATTERN VALIDATION:
1. Correct Pattern: "Use the scene-generator subagent to create initial chapter content"
2. Correct Pattern: "Use the entity-validator subagent to verify character consistency"
3. Correct Pattern: "Use the bible-compliance-validator subagent to check adherence"

PROHIBITED PATTERNS AVOIDED:
- No Task() function calls in configuration
- No direct tool invocation syntax
- No Python script references
- No recursive Task tool usage

EXECUTION UNDERSTANDING:
- Configuration layer: Natural language descriptions
- Execution layer: Claude interprets and executes
- Output display: Task(description) indicates normal operation
- Sub-agents: Use only Read, Write, Bash tools

ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE:
- Commands delegate to Coordinators
- Coordinators orchestrate Agents
- Agents perform specific tasks
- All communication through file system

Phase 3: Natural Language Testing - COMPLETE
Status: All patterns validated successfully
