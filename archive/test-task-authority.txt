=== TASK TOOL AUTHORITY DOCUMENTATION ===
Test Time: Thu, Sep 11, 2025 10:40:32 PM

FINDINGS:
1. Task Tool Usage Patterns:
   - Only Claude (main agent) can use Task tool
   - Sub-agents must use Read, Write, Bash tools only
   - Configuration files use natural language: "Use the [agent] subagent to..."
   - Execution shows: Task(description) - this is normal output
   
2. Architecture Understanding:
   - Commands layer: Declarative instructions (<100 lines optimal)
   - Coordinators layer: Flow orchestration and agent coordination
   - Agents layer: Specific task execution (single responsibility)
   
3. Prohibited Patterns:
   - Task() function calls in configuration files (pseudo-code)
   - Sub-agents including Task in tools list
   - Python script calls to claude_subagents.py (doesn't exist)
   
4. Correct Execution Flow:
   User Input → Command (description) → Claude interprets → Claude executes (may use multiple coordinators/agents)
