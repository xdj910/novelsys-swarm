# Pipeline Debug Analysis

## ✅ Confirmed Issues

### 1. **Agent Files Exist**
All specialist agents are present:
- ✅ world-clue-specialist.md
- ✅ continuity-guard-specialist.md
- ✅ emotion-specialist.md
- ✅ prose-craft-specialist.md
- ✅ foreshadowing-specialist.md
- ✅ cozy-mystery-specialist.md (should be in .claude/agents/)
- ✅ humanization-specialist.md
- ✅ author-voice-signature-specialist.md

### 2. **Input File Dependencies**
Each specialist expects specific input files:
- Step 3 expects: v02_dialogue_character.md ✅ (exists)
- Step 4 expects: v03_world_clues.md ❌ (missing)
- Step 5 expects: v04_continuity_checked.md ❌ (missing)
- Step 6 expects: v05_emotions_woven.md ❌ (missing)
- Step 7 expects: v06_prose_polished.md ❌ (missing)
- Step 8 expects: v07_foreshadowing_added.md ❌ (missing)
- Step 9 expects: v08_genre_enhanced.md OR v07 ❌ (missing)
- Step 10 expects: v09_humanized.md ❌ BUT GOT v10 anyway!

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Most Likely Scenario: **Cascade Failure**

1. **Step 3 (world-clue-specialist) failed silently**
   - Possible reasons:
     - Agent couldn't find v02 file (path issue)
     - Agent failed to save v03 (write permission/path issue)
     - Agent wasn't actually called by coordinator

2. **Steps 4-9 couldn't execute**
   - Each depends on previous version file
   - Missing v03 → can't create v04 → can't create v05, etc.

3. **Step 10 (author-voice-signature) succeeded anyway**
   - Likely has fallback logic to read ANY available version
   - Found v02 and processed it directly
   - This masked the pipeline failure!

## 🐛 Critical Bug Found

### In author-voice-signature-specialist:
The agent probably has flexible input logic like:
```
If v09_humanized.md exists:
    read v09
Else if v08_genre_enhanced.md exists:
    read v08
Else if v07_foreshadowing_added.md exists:
    read v07
...
Else:
    read any latest version available
```

This allows it to work even when pipeline is broken!

## 🔧 Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Coordinator Execution
Look for evidence that Step 3 was actually called:
- Was Task tool invoked for world-clue-specialist?
- Any error messages?
- Did coordinator stop after Step 2?

### 2. Path Issues
Verify paths are correct:
- Project name: "Teide Cove Mysteries" (has spaces!)
- This might cause issues with path handling

### 3. Agent Input Validation
Check if agents validate input existence:
- Do they fail gracefully or silently?
- Do they have proper error reporting?

## 🛠️ Recommended Fixes

### 1. **Immediate Fix for Coordinator**
Add mandatory verification after each step:
```markdown
After calling each specialist:
1. Verify output file exists
2. If missing, retry up to 3 times
3. If still missing, STOP with clear error
4. Never proceed to next step without verification
```

### 2. **Fix Agent Input Validation**
Each agent should:
```markdown
1. CHECK input file exists
2. If missing: ERROR and exit (don't continue)
3. Never use fallback files without explicit permission
```

### 3. **Fix author-voice-signature Fallback**
Should ONLY accept v09_humanized.md as input
No fallback to earlier versions

### 4. **Add Pipeline Status Tracking**
Create pipeline_status.json:
```json
{
  "chapter": 1,
  "steps_completed": [1, 2, 10],
  "steps_failed": [3],
  "steps_skipped": [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
  "errors": ["Step 3: world-clue-specialist failed - input file not found"]
}
```

## 🚨 Action Items

1. **Re-run chapter generation with verbose logging**
2. **Monitor each step execution carefully**
3. **Check for path/space issues with "Teide Cove Mysteries"**
4. **Verify coordinator is actually calling all agents**
5. **Add proper error handling to prevent silent failures**

## Prevention Measures

1. **Mandatory step verification in coordinator**
2. **No fallback logic in agents - fail fast**
3. **Pipeline status tracking file**
4. **Clear error messages at each failure point**
5. **Integration tests for full pipeline**
