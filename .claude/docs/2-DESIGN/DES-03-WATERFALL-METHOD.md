# Waterfall Documentation Structure

## Document Hierarchy and Dependencies

```
Phase 1: Requirements
├── REQUIREMENTS.md (functional/non-functional)
├── USER_SCENARIOS.md (use cases)
└── SCOPE_DEFINITION.md (boundaries)
    ↓ Gate Review ↓

Phase 2: Design
├── SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md (technical design)
├── DATA_MODEL.md (schemas/formats)
├── WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md (process flows)
└── INTERFACE_DESIGN.md (commands/agents)
    ↓ Gate Review ↓

Phase 3: Implementation
├── commands/ (user interface layer)

## Document Creation Order

### Week 1: Requirements Phase
1. REQUIREMENTS.md
2. USER_SCENARIOS.md
3. SCOPE_DEFINITION.md

### Week 2-3: Design Phase
1. SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md
2. DATA_MODEL.md
3. WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md
4. INTERFACE_DESIGN.md

### Week 4-6: Implementation Phase
Order determined by INTERFACE_DESIGN.md

### Week 7: Testing Phase
1. TEST_PLAN.md (before testing)
2. Test execution logs (during)
3. DEFECT_LOG.md (during)
4. TEST_REPORT.md (after)

### Week 8: Deployment Phase
1. USER_GUIDE.md
2. DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md
3. MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md
4. RELEASE_NOTES.md

## Key Principles

1. **Sequential Execution**: Each phase must complete before next begins
2. **Gate Reviews**: Formal approval required to proceed
3. **Complete Documentation**: All docs finished before coding
4. **No Backtracking**: Changes require formal change request
5. **Traceability**: Requirements traced through all phases

## Change Management

If changes needed after gate approval:
1. Submit formal change request
2. Impact analysis on all phases
3. Approval from stakeholders
4. Update all affected documents
5. Re-execute affected phases

## Quality Checkpoints

### Document Quality
- Clear and unambiguous
- Complete coverage
- Consistent terminology
- Proper versioning
- Review signatures

### Implementation Quality
- Follows design exactly
- No unauthorized features
- Proper error handling
- Complete logging
- Code documentation

### Testing Quality
- Requirements coverage
- Edge case testing
- Performance validation
- User acceptance
- Regression prevention

*Strict waterfall process ensuring complete design before implementation begins.*
