## Unified Command Structure

### Smart Type Detection
```bash
/write "My idea"              # System detects type from context
/write article "Topic"        # Explicit article
/write story "Premise"        # Short story
/write novel "Title"          # Novel
/write series "Epic Title"    # Multi-book series
/write blog "Post topic"      # Blog post
```

### Universal Commands
```bash
# Core commands work for all types
/write:start [type] [title]   # Initialize project
/write:content [section]      # Generate content
/write:improve [section]      # Enhance quality
/write:status                 # Check progress
/write:export                 # Output in appropriate format
```

### Type-Specific Commands
```bash
# Article specific
/write:research [topic]       # Gather information
/write:cite [source]          # Add citations

# Fiction specific
/write:character [name]       # Develop character
/write:worldbuild [aspect]    # Expand world

# Series specific
/write:timeline              # Manage series timeline
/write:crossref              # Check continuity
```

## Adaptive Bible System

### Minimal Bible (Articles/Blogs)
```yaml
topic: "AI in Healthcare"
audience: "Healthcare professionals"
length: 2000
tone: "Professional but accessible"
key_points:
  - Current applications
  - Future potential
  - Ethical considerations
```

### Standard Bible (Short Stories)
```yaml
premise: "A memory collector's last day"
protagonist:
  name: "Sam"
  want: "To preserve one perfect memory"
  obstacle: "Memory storage is failing"
setting: "Near-future city"
theme: "What makes a memory worth keeping?"
```

### Comprehensive Bible (Novels/Series)
```yaml
# Full world-building
# Complete character roster
# Detailed plot structure
# Theme exploration
# Style guide
# (As detailed in NOVEL_WORKFLOW_v1.md)
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Type Router
```python
def route_writing_request(user_input):
    # Analyze input to determine type
    detected_type = analyze_content_type(user_input)

    # Load appropriate configuration
    config = load_config(detected_type)

    # Select specialized components
    coordinator = get_coordinator(detected_type)
    agents = get_agents(detected_type)
    quality_scorer = get_quality_scorer(detected_type)

    return create_workflow(config, coordinator, agents, quality_scorer)
```

### 2. Dynamic Agent Selection
```yaml
Article Agents:
  - research-gatherer
  - fact-checker
  - argument-builder
  - citation-manager

Fiction Agents:
  - character-developer
  - dialogue-writer
  - scene-builder
  - emotion-weaver

Universal Agents:
  - content-writer
  - quality-scorer
  - style-enforcer
  - grammar-checker
```

### 3. Flexible Quality Scoring
```python
def score_quality(content, content_type):
    # Load type-specific rubric
    rubric = get_rubric(content_type)

    # Apply weighted scoring
    scores = {}
    for criterion in rubric:
        scores[criterion] = evaluate(content, criterion)

    # Return weighted total
    return calculate_weighted_score(scores, rubric.weights)
```

## Workflow Adaptation

### For Articles (Linear)
```
Research -> Outline -> Draft -> Fact-check -> Polish -> Publish
```

### For Short Stories (Focused)
```
Concept -> Character -> Conflict -> Resolution -> Polish
```

### For Novels (Iterative)
```
Bible -> Outline -> Chapters -> Revisions -> Context-sync -> More chapters
```

### For Series (Hierarchical)
```
Series Bible -> Book Bible -> Book 1 -> Review continuity -> Book 2...
```

## Content Progression Examples

### Article Example
```bash
> /write article "Future of Remote Work"

1. Research phase: Gathering latest studies...
2. Outline generated: Intro, 3 main points, conclusion
3. Drafting: 2,500 words on target
4. Fact-checking: 12 sources verified
5. Quality: 88/100 - Ready to publish!

Suggested: /write:export markdown
```

### Short Story Example
```bash
> /write story "The last bookstore"

1. Concept developed: Dystopian future, books are forbidden
2. Protagonist created: Elderly bookstore owner
3. Conflict established: Final day before closure
4. Draft complete: 5,200 words
5. Quality: 85/100 - Emotional impact achieved!

Suggested: /write:improve ending
```

### Novel Series Example
```bash
> /write series "Chronicles of Memory"

1. Series bible created: 5-book arc planned
2. Book 1 bible ready: "The Memory Keeper"
3. Starting Book 1, Chapter 1...
[... progression ...]
Chapter 20 complete. Book 1 finished!
4. Continuity check: All threads consistent

Suggested: /write:start book2
```

## Key Advantages

1. **One System to Learn** - Users master one interface for all writing needs
2. **Skill Transfer** - Improvements in one type benefit others
3. **Flexible Workflow** - Adapt to different creative processes
4. **Consistent Quality** - Unified quality standards
5. **Resource Efficiency** - Shared components and learning

## Migration Path

From current novel-only system:
1. Abstract novel-specific components
2. Create type detection layer
3. Add article and short story modes
4. Test with diverse content types
5. Gradually add more formats

## Conclusion

This universal writing system is not just technically feasible - it's the logical evolution. By recognizing that all writing shares core principles (structure, quality, coherence) while differing in specific requirements, we can create a powerful, adaptable system that grows with user needs.

The same AI that helps write a blog post on Monday can help craft a novel chapter on Tuesday and research an article on Wednesday. This is the future of AI-assisted writing: one intelligent system that understands context and adapts accordingly.
