## Common Voice Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Voice Drift**: Starting warm, becoming cold
2. **Vocabulary Inconsistency**: Simple then suddenly complex
3. **Pacing Whiplash**: Fast action then sudden contemplation
4. **Dialogue Imbalance**: Heavy dialogue then pages of narrative
5. **Emotion Rollercoaster**: Intense drama in cozy mystery
6. **Detail Overload**: Rich descriptions in fast thriller
7. **Cultural Confusion**: British terms in American setting
8. **Market Mismatch**: UK humor for US audience
9. **Setting Disconnect**: Urban pace in rural story

## The Golden Rule

> "The best voice is invisible to the reader. They should be absorbed in the story, not noticing the writing."

Your voice should serve the story and please the reader, not showcase your vocabulary or stylistic range.
