# MVP Implementation Plan - Universal Writing System

## Executive Summary
A phased approach to build a universal writing system supporting articles, short stories, novels, and series using waterfall methodology with strict phase gates.

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering (Week 1)
### Deliverables
- REQUIREMENTS.md - Functional and non-functional requirements
- USER_SCENARIOS.md - User stories and use cases
- SCOPE_DEFINITION.md - MVP boundaries and constraints

### Key Activities
1. Define core writing workflows
2. Identify user interaction points
3. Establish system boundaries
4. Document acceptance criteria

## Phase 2: System Design (Week 2-3)
### Deliverables
- SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md - Technical architecture
- DATA_MODEL.md - File structures and schemas
- WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md - Process flows
- INTERFACE_DESIGN.md - Command and agent specifications

### Key Activities
1. Design 5-layer architecture components
2. Define data formats (YAML, JSON, Markdown)
3. Map workflow states and transitions
4. Specify agent responsibilities

## Phase 3: Implementation (Week 4-6)
### Core Components Build Order

#### 3.1 Foundation Layer (Week 4)
1. **project-init** command - Initialize new writing project
2. **project-config** coordinator - Manage project settings
3. **file-structure-agent** - Create project directories
4. **config-writer-agent** - Write configuration files

#### 3.2 Content Creation Layer (Week 5)
1. **content-start** command - Begin new content piece
2. **content-type-detector** coordinator - Identify content type
3. **outline-generator-agent** - Create content outline
4. **draft-writer-agent** - Generate initial draft
5. **human-feedback-agent** - Collect user input

#### 3.3 Processing Layer (Week 6)
1. **content-enhance** command - Improve existing content
2. **quality-coordinator** - Orchestrate quality checks
3. **consistency-checker-agent** - Verify internal consistency
4. **style-optimizer-agent** - Apply style guidelines
5. **format-exporter-agent** - Export to various formats

## Phase 4: Testing (Week 7)
### Test Scenarios
1. Create article from scratch
2. Generate short story with plot
3. Build novel chapter sequence
4. Manage series continuity
5. Human-in-loop feedback cycles

### Validation Points
- File structure integrity
- Workflow state management
- Content consistency
- Export format accuracy

## Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment (Week 8)
### Final Deliverables
1. USER_GUIDE.md - How to use the system
2. DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md - How to extend the system
3. MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md - How to maintain the system
4. Release package with all components

## MVP Feature Set

### Included
- Project initialization for all content types
- Basic content generation workflow
- Human-in-loop brainstorming (Phase 0)
- Single chapter/article creation
- Basic quality checking
- Markdown export

### Excluded (Future Releases)
- Advanced AI personas
- Multi-chapter parallel generation
- Complex series management
- Publishing integrations
- Version control beyond basic

## Success Criteria
1. Can create a complete article (500-2000 words)
2. Can generate a short story (2000-7500 words)
3. Can produce a novel chapter (3000-5000 words)
4. Human can effectively guide creative process
5. Output meets basic quality standards

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Scope Creep**: Strict MVP boundaries, defer advanced features
2. **Complexity**: Start with single-file outputs, add multi-file later
3. **Integration**: Use existing 5-layer architecture patterns
4. **Quality**: Implement basic checks first, enhance iteratively

## Timeline Summary
- Week 1: Requirements complete
- Week 2-3: Design complete
- Week 4-6: Implementation complete
- Week 7: Testing complete
- Week 8: Documentation and deployment

## Next Steps
1. Create REQUIREMENTS.md document
2. Begin user scenario collection
3. Define MVP scope boundaries
4. Establish phase gate review process
