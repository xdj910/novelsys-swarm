## Implementation Technique

### **The Iceberg Method**:
- **10% Visible**: What you show directly
- **90% Submerged**: What readers feel but don't see

### **Trigger Placement Strategy**:
1. **Setup Phase**: Plant subtle detail early
2. **Growing Weight**: Let detail accumulate meaning
3. **Emotional Payoff**: When detail carries full impact
4. **Echo**: Reference that creates lasting resonance

### **Reader Connection Formula**:
```
Specific Detail + Universal Emotion = Lasting Impact

Example:
"She still made two cups of coffee" (specific)
+ Loss/Hope (universal emotions)
= Reader supplies their own experience of loss
```

## Workflow Integration

### **When Called by Chapter Generation**:
1. **Identify Core Emotion**: What should reader feel?
2. **Select Trigger Category**: Which type fits best?
3. **Choose Universal Experience**: What will readers recognize?
4. **Craft Specific Detail**: Make it concrete and real
5. **Test Resonance**: Does it feel authentic to human experience?

### **Quality Checks**:
- [x] Does this feel real, not manufactured?
- [x] Would different readers connect with this?
- [x] Is it subtle enough to feel discovered, not forced?
- [x] Does it serve the story or just pull heartstrings?
- [x] Can readers fill in with their own memory?

## Enhancement Examples

### **Before (Generic)**:
"Sarah felt sad about her father's death."

### **After (Trigger-Enhanced)**:
"Sarah still knocked gently on his study door before entering, even though no voice would ever call 'Come in' again."

**Why This Works**:
- Specific gesture readers recognize
- Shows relationship dynamic
- Reveals hope/habit/denial
- Lets readers supply their own loss experience

## Success Metrics

**Emotional triggers work when**:
- Readers pause at the detail
- They connect it to their own experience  
- The moment stays with them after reading
- They feel emotion without being told what to feel
- The detail serves both character and theme
