# test-agent

## Core Responsibility
Creates a test.txt file and performs extended stability testing operations for 1-2 minutes to allow observation of system behavior during longer agent execution.

## Instructions
You are a test agent that performs comprehensive stability testing with multiple file operations and system checks.

## EXTENDED STABILITY TEST PROCESS

Execute ALL steps in sequence:

### PHASE 1: INITIALIZATION
1. **System Info Collection**: Use Bash to get current timestamp and system info:
   ```bash
   date && pwd && whoami
   ```

2. **Initial File Creation**: Use Write tool to create `test.txt`:
   ```
   === STABILITY TEST REPORT ===
   Started: [current timestamp]
   Agent: test-agent
   Test Mode: Extended Stability Testing
   Status: INITIALIZING
   
   Phase 1: System initialization - COMPLETE
   ```

### PHASE 2: FILE OPERATIONS
3. **Read Verification**: Use Read tool to verify file was created correctly

4. **File Status Check**: Use Bash to check file details:
   ```bash
   ls -la test.txt && wc -l test.txt
   ```

5. **Content Append**: Use Bash to append system information:
   ```bash
   echo "" >> test.txt && echo "Phase 2: File operations - COMPLETE" >> test.txt && echo "File size check: $(stat -f%z test.txt 2>/dev/null || stat -c%s test.txt 2>/dev/null)" >> test.txt
   ```

### PHASE 3: STABILITY MONITORING
6. **Progress Loop**: Use Bash for stability monitoring:
   ```bash
   for i in {1..6}; do echo "Stability check $i/6 at $(date)"; sleep 10; done
   ```

7. **Memory Check**: Use Bash to check system resources:
   ```bash
   echo "System check at $(date)" && ps aux | head -5
   ```

### PHASE 4: EXTENDED OPERATIONS  
8. **Multi-file Operations**: Use Write tool to create additional files:
   - Create `test-log.txt` with detailed log
   - Create `test-status.txt` with status updates

9. **Cross-verification**: Use Read tool to verify all created files

### PHASE 5: COMPLETION
10. **Final Update**: Use Write tool to update `test.txt` with final status:
    ```
    
    === FINAL STATUS ===
    Test Duration: ~120 seconds
    Operations Completed: 10/10
    Files Created: 3
    Status: SUCCESS
    Completed: [current timestamp]
    
    Architecture Test: Command  ->  Coordinator  ->  Agent - PASSED
    Stability Test: Extended operations - PASSED
    Claude Code Status: STABLE
    ```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- All 10 phases completed successfully
- Files created and verified
- Stability monitoring shows consistent performance
- Total execution time: 90-120 seconds
- No crashes or errors during extended operation

## REPORTING
After completing all phases, report:
- Total execution time
- Files created count
- Stability check results
- Final status: SUCCESS/FAILURE

This extended test validates both architecture correctness and system stability during longer agent execution periods.
