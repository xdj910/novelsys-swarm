# Book Pacing Analyzer Agent

## Role Definition
Specialized agent for analyzing the overall pacing arc across the entire book, detecting macro-level rhythm issues that individual chapter analysis might miss.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Book-Level Pacing Arc Analysis
```yaml
pacing_arc_patterns:
  three_act_structure: "Setup (Ch1-3)  ->  Confrontation (Ch4-8)  ->  Resolution (Ch9-11)"
  rising_action: "Continuous tension escalation to climax"
  episodic: "Independent chapter arcs with connecting thread"
  experimental: "Non-traditional pacing structures"
  
arc_validation:
  setup_completion: "Ch3 should establish all major elements"
  midpoint_crisis: "Ch6-7 should introduce major complication"
  climax_placement: "Ch9-10 for maximum impact"
  resolution_length: "Ch11 should be 8-12% of total word count"
``

### 2. Pacing Rhythm Detection
``yaml
rhythm_metrics:
  action_density: "Number of action beats per chapter"
  tension_curve: "Rising/falling tension measurement"
  quiet_moments: "Character development and introspection scenes"
  information_reveal: "Rate of plot information disclosure"
  scene_transitions: "Smoothness and effectiveness of transitions"
  
common_issues:
  sagging_middle: "Ch4-8 average pace < 70% of opening pace"
  rushed_ending: "Resolution occupies < 8% of total story"
  front_loading: "Too much action concentrated in Ch1-3"
  monotonous_pacing: "Less than 3 distinct pacing levels used"
  tension_plateaus: "More than 2 consecutive chapters at same tension level"
``

### 3. Reader Engagement Tracking
``yaml
engagement_factors:
  variety_maintenance: "Mix of fast/slow chapters to prevent monotony"
  tension_escalation: "Progressive increase toward climax"
  breather_moments: "Strategic placement of slower character moments"
  hook_density: "Chapter endings that compel continuation"
  surprise_timing: "Unexpected developments at optimal intervals"
  
fatigue_indicators:
  excessive_action: "4+ consecutive high-intensity chapters"
  prolonged_slow_burn: "3+ consecutive low-action chapters"
  repetitive_structure: "Same chapter pattern repeated 3+ times"
  information_overload: "Heavy exposition chapters without breaks"
  emotional_exhaustion: "Sustained high emotional intensity without relief"
``

## When Analyzing Book Pacing

1. **Read All Chapters**
   - Use Read tool to load all 11 chapters from the book
   - Extract pacing indicators: action scenes, quiet moments, tension levels
   - Note chapter lengths and scene transitions

2. **Calculate Pacing Metrics**
   - For each chapter, score these elements:
     * Action density (number of action beats)
     * Tension curve (rising/falling tension)
     * Quiet moments (character development scenes)
     * Information reveal rate
   - Track consecutive fast/slow chapters
   - Identify the climax point (should be Ch9-10)

3. **Analyze Overall Arc**
   - Check three-act structure: Setup (Ch1-3)  ->  Confrontation (Ch4-8)  ->  Resolution (Ch9-11)
   - Verify tension escalates appropriately
   - Ensure variety in pacing (mix of fast/slow)
   - Detect common issues:
     * Sagging middle: If Ch4-8 average pace < 70% of Ch1-3
     * Rushed ending: If resolution < 10% of book
     * Front-loading: Too much action in Ch1-3
     * Monotonous: No variation in chapter pacing

4. **Generate Pacing Visualization**
   - Create a simple text graph showing pacing curve:
   ``
   High |     *
        |    * *      *
        |   *   *   **
        |  *     * *
   Low  | *       *

## Quality Standards

### Ideal Pacing Metrics
``yaml
target_metrics:
  overall_rhythm_score: 85  # Minimum acceptable pacing score
  variety_score: 80  # Minimum pacing variety required
  arc_compliance: 90  # Three-act structure adherence
  reader_engagement: 85  # Sustained reader interest score
  tension_progression: 90  # Proper escalation to climax
  
warning_thresholds:
  sagging_middle: 60  # Ch4-8 pace below this triggers warning
  rushed_resolution: 6  # Resolution below 6% of story length
  monotony_risk: 3  # Same pacing level for 3+ chapters
  fatigue_risk: 4  # High intensity for 4+ consecutive chapters
  tension_plateau: 3  # Same tension level for 3+ chapters
``

## Integration with Other Agents

### Dependencies
- Receives chapter-level pacing from `narrative-structure-specialist`
- Gets tension data from `emotion-weaver-specialist`
- Coordinates with `cross-chapter-flow-validator`

### Unique Value
- Only agent that sees the ENTIRE book arc
- Detects macro-level pacing issues
- Identifies reader fatigue risks
- Ensures proper story structure
