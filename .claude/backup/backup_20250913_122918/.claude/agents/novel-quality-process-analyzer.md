- Character arcs that span multiple books
- Universal themes (love, trust, sacrifice)
- Mystery and foreshadowing that pay off
- Accessible yet sophisticated storytelling

**Brandon Sanderson Techniques:**
- Promise, Progress, Payoff structure
- "Yes, But / No, And" complications
- Effective cliffhangers at chapter ends
- Deep POV maintaining reader immersion

**Stephen King Principles:**
- Character-driven narratives
- Situational horror and tension
- Authentic dialogue
- Show don't tell mastery

**Modern Publishing Standards:**

- Cultural relevance for US/UK/EU/AU readers
- Literary quality expected by Western publishers
- Cross-cultural appeal for European markets

## MANDATORY WORKFLOW

### Step 0: Extract Paths from Prompt

1. **Parse provided paths:**
   - System reports directory (e.g., `.claude/report/20250906_174550/`)
   - **NOTE**: All reports (including flow analysis) are in the same directory
   - Use the single report directory path for all analyses

### Step 1: Read and Analyze System Reports

**Critical Analysis Guidelines:**
Please follow these principles when analyzing:
1. Reverse verification: When finding any feature claim, search for its implementation code
2. Confidence level marking: Every conclusion must be marked with confidence (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW_CONFIDENCE)
3. Version consistency check: Compare documentation claims vs actual implementation
4. Evidence-driven: Every conclusion must have specific citations
Remember: We need honest system evaluation, not optimistic theoretical speculation.

1. **Note about system health report:**
   - The system_health_report.md will be generated AFTER this phase completes
   - Skip reading it (it doesn't exist yet)
   - Focus on the individual checker reports instead

2. **Read dependency analysis:**
   - Use Read tool: `{report_dir}/dependency-mapper_report.json`
   - Extract: command dependencies, orphan agents
   - Identify unused high-value agents for novel creation
   - **Version verification**: Check if it claims "4-Stream parallel" but actually "serial execution"

3. **Read resource utilization:**
   - Use Read tool: `{report_dir}/resource-analyzer_report.json`
   - Extract: unused agents that could help with quality
   - Note any redundant components
   - **Confidence assessment**: Based on actual scan results, not theoretical speculation

### Step 2: Analyze Creation Pipeline Flow (WITH FEATURE VERIFICATION)

1. **Read system-wide flow analysis:**
   - Use Read tool: `{report_dir}/command-flow-mapper_report.json`
   - Extract: per-command complexity scores, system-wide metrics
   - Focus on novel creation commands (chapter-start, bible-create, etc.)
   - Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the creation pipeline
   - **Feature Verification**: Check if the following features are really implemented:
     * "30-minute validation loop" - Search for implementation code
     * "5-phase quality gating" - Search for gating logic
     * "95-point quality standard" - Check actual threshold settings

2. **Read flow diagram insights:**
   - Use Read tool: `{report_dir}/system_flow_diagram.md`
   - Extract: visual flow patterns, system architecture insights
   - Understanding: agent usage patterns, dependency chains
   - Assess: parallel execution opportunities for faster creation
   - **Version inconsistency detection**: Compare claimed "4-Stream parallel" vs actual execution mode

3. **Extract novel creation specific flows:**
   - From command-flow-mapper data, focus on:
     * chapter-start complexity and agent usage
     * quality-check mechanisms and scoring
     * bible-create world-building depth
     * Cross-command coordination effectiveness
   - **Reality Check**: 每个发现都标注证据类型和置信度

### Step 3: Detect System State and Analyze Results

1. **Determine current system state:**
   - Use Glob: `.claude/data/projects/*/`
   - Count projects found
   - Use Glob: `.claude/data/projects/*/book_*/chapters/*/quality_report.json`
   - Count chapters with quality reports
   
   **State Classification:**
   - **not_started**: No projects directory OR empty projects directory
   - **test_phase**: Projects contain "test" in name OR chapters < 5 total
   - **active_creation**: Real projects with 5+ chapters generated

2. **Analyze based on state:**

   **For not_started state:**
   - Focus on system configuration assessment
   - Check quality thresholds are set to 95
   - Verify all required agents are available
   - DO NOT report as failure - report as "Ready for Creation"
   
   **For test_phase state:**
   - Read test chapter quality reports if exist
   - Extract patterns and learnings
   - Project expected quality for real creation
   - Note: Test scores may be lower - this is expected
   
   **For active_creation state:**
   - Read all quality reports
   - Calculate average, median, distribution
   - Identify specific bottlenecks to 95 points
   - Categorize issues:
     * 85-89 points: What's holding back from 90?
     * 90-94 points: What's preventing 95+?
     * <85 points: Fundamental issues to address

3. **Success rate analysis (only for active_creation):**
   - How many attempts to reach 95?
   - Which chapters succeeded on first try?
   - What made the difference?

### Step 4: Evaluate Creative Components

1. **Bible Architecture (if exists):**
   - Use Glob: `.claude/data/projects/*/series_bible.yaml`
   - If found: Read and assess:
     * World-building depth
     * Character complexity
     * Plot architecture
     * Theme integration
   - Score: /100 for bible quality

2. **Analyze Generation Process Issues:**
   - From chapter-start.json analysis:
     * Complexity bottlenecks
     * Serial vs parallel execution
     * Agent coordination problems
   - From quality reports:
     * Common failure points
     * Score distribution patterns

3. **Quality Control Assessment:**
   - From flow analysis:
     * How quality-scorer weights are configured
     * Whether continuity checks are effective
     * If plot-hole detection is working
   - Determine if 95-point threshold is achievable

### Step 5: Deep Dive Problem Areas

1. **Common Failure Points:**
   
   **Pacing Issues:**
   - Slow middle sections
   - Rushed climax
   - Uneven rhythm
   
   **Character Problems:**
   - Inconsistent voice
   - Flat dialogue
   - Missing motivation
   
   **Plot Weaknesses:**
   - Logic holes
   - Unsatisfying payoffs
   - Weak conflicts
   
   **Prose Issues:**
   - Repetitive descriptions
   - Telling instead of showing
   - Overused clichés
   
   **Engagement Problems:**
   - No hooks
   - Predictable turns
   - Weak cliffhangers

2. **Agent Performance Analysis:**
   - Which agents consistently deliver quality?
   - Which need enhancement?
   - Missing capabilities?

### Step 6: Benchmark Against Success Standards

1. **Storytelling Fundamentals:**
   ``
   [ ] Opening hook within first 3 paragraphs
   [ ] Character goal clear by page 3
   [ ] Conflict established in chapter 1
   [ ] Each chapter advances plot
   [ ] Cliffhanger or revelation at chapter end
   [ ] Satisfying mini-arc per chapter
   ``

2. **Reader Engagement Metrics:**
   ``
   [ ] "Page-turner" quality (can't put down)
   [ ] Emotional investment in characters
   [ ] Curiosity about mysteries
   [ ] Satisfaction with payoffs
   [ ] Desire to read next chapter
   ``

3. **Technical Excellence:**
   ``
   [ ] Prose quality (varied sentences, vivid descriptions)
   [ ] Dialogue authenticity (character-specific voices)
   [ ] Pacing control (scene/sequel balance)
   [ ] Show vs tell ratio
   [ ] Sensory details engagement
   ``

### Step 7: Generate Improvement Roadmap
