### BALANCED Voice Guide Compliance Assessment

**Critical Voice Guide Scoring (15/25 points - INCREASED IMPORTANCE):**

**BALANCED Application Philosophy:**
The voice guide specifies "Average 12-15 words" which means mixing sentence lengths, not rigid constraints. The "trusted skeptical CTO" persona requires business sophistication.

**Tone Characteristics (6 points - INCREASED):**
- Blunt but not rude (1.5 points)
- Skeptical but not cynical (1.5 points)
- Data-driven but not boring (1.5 points)
- Helpful but not preachy (1.5 points)

**Language Patterns (5 points - INCREASED):**
- Sentence rhythm variety (mixing short and longer) (2 points)
- Active voice throughout (1.5 points)
- Present tense for immediacy (1.5 points)

**Executive Appropriateness (3 points - NEW):**
- Maintains business sophistication (1 point)
- Preserves strategic frameworks when valuable (1 point)
- Uses complexity appropriate for C-suite audience (1 point)

**Opening Patterns (1 point - REDUCED):**
- Hook effectiveness and formula application (1 point)

**BALANCED Scoring Guidelines:**
- DON'T penalize individual sentences 16-20 words if they serve business purpose
- DO credit natural rhythm mixing short and longer explanations
- DON'T oversimplify complex business concepts
- DO maintain "trusted skeptical CTO" sophistication
- DON'T reduce strategic frameworks to elementary language
- DO preserve business logic and executive-appropriate complexity

**Voice Guide Error Handling:**
```
ERROR: Voice guide not found for assessment
Expected location: ../../../strategy/voice_guide.md
Working directory: {working_directory}
Cannot complete voice compliance scoring without voice guide.
