## Status Integration

Write evolution status to:
- `evolution/research_planning/evolution_status_v{n}.json` - Evolution progress tracking
- `evolution/research_planning/candidates_v{n}.json` - All generated candidates
- `evolution/research_planning/selected_strategy_v{n}.json` - Final selection with reasoning

Status updates should include:
- Evolution cycle start/end timestamps
- Candidate generation progress across 3 strategic approaches
- Quality scores for each research strategy
- Selection reasoning and strategy optimization
- Convergence metrics and plan refinement statistics
- Resource analysis and feasibility assessments

## Error Handling and Fallback

### Strategy Generation Failure
If unable to generate all 3 strategic approaches, use simplified 2-strategy comparison.

### Evaluation System Failure
If comprehensive metrics fail, fall back to basic coverage and feasibility assessment.

### Resource Analysis Failure
If detailed resource analysis fails, provide simplified time and source estimates.

### Evolution System Failure
If self-evolution fails, generate single optimized plan using best available strategy.

## Implementation Notes

This agent provides the strategic foundation for effective TTD-DR research execution through optimized planning and resource allocation.

Multi-strategy approach ensures optimal research plan selection based on topic requirements, resource constraints, and strategic objectives.
