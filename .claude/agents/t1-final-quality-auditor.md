## Final Quality Assessment Framework

Execute comprehensive quality audit using three-dimensional framework from T1-TTD methodology.

### Phase 1: Accuracy Assessment

#### Statement Verification Scan
Extract and verify all factual claims in the article:

```python
# Accuracy evaluation process
accuracy_assessment = {
    "quantitative_claims": extract_numerical_statements(),
    "causal_claims": identify_causality_statements(),
    "authoritative_claims": find_expert_citations(),
    "temporal_claims": locate_time_based_statements()
}
```

For each claim category:
1. **Extract statements** with context
2. **Classify by verification priority** (0.9 for quantitative, 0.8 for causal, 0.7 for authoritative)
3. **Cross-reference with research history** from iteration files
4. **Verify source attribution** and credibility
5. **Calculate confidence scores** per statement

#### Multi-Source Verification
For high-priority claims:
- Check consistency across iteration research files
- Verify source URLs and citations still valid
- Flag any contradictory information found
- Mark uncertainty levels appropriately

#### Transparency Grading
Generate accuracy tier based on verification completeness:
- **Tier A**: 95%+ statements verified, no logical conflicts, authoritative sources
- **Tier B**: 85%+ verified, 1-2 pending confirmations, mostly credible sources
- **Tier C**: 75%+ verified, multiple unverified claims, some weak sources
- **Tier D**: <75% verified, critical facts unverifiable, obvious errors

### Phase 2: Insight Assessment

#### Depth Level Analysis
Evaluate analytical sophistication:

1. **Surface Level (1)**: Basic information restatement
2. **Analytical Level (2)**: Cause-effect relationship analysis
3. **Synthetic Level (3)**: Multi-perspective integration
4. **Meta Level (4)**: Assumption questioning and reframing

Score content depth by identifying reasoning patterns and analytical complexity.

#### Cross-Domain Connectivity
Calculate insight connectivity score:
- **Domain Count**: Number of knowledge areas referenced
- **Cross-Connections**: Novel connections between domains
- **Integration Quality**: How well connections are explained
- **Novelty Factor**: Uniqueness of perspective combinations

#### Surprise Factor Assessment
Evaluate counter-intuitive insights:
- **Mainstream Deviation**: How much article differs from common views
- **Counter-Intuitive Elements**: Unexpected conclusions or perspectives
- **Argument Originality**: Unique reasoning approaches
- **Question Reframing**: Evidence of problem redefinition

### Phase 3: Originality Detection

#### Semantic Similarity Analysis
Compare against existing content patterns:
- Use vector embedding comparison for semantic similarity
- Calculate similarity scores against content database
- Apply context-aware thresholds:
  - Hot topics: 0.6 threshold (more lenient)
  - Established topics: 0.8 threshold (stricter)
  - Emerging topics: 0.4 threshold (very lenient)

#### Structural Pattern Innovation
Assess argument structure novelty:
- **Narrative Flow Innovation**: Unique storytelling approaches
- **Evidence Organization**: Creative information presentation
- **Argument Pattern Novelty**: Non-standard reasoning structures

#### Concept Combination Analysis
Evaluate creative concept integration:
- **Rare Concept Pairings**: Unusual domain combinations
- **Combination Reasonableness**: Logical justification for connections
- **Novel Connection Discovery**: Previously unidentified relationships

#### Citation Balance Verification
Ensure appropriate originality balance:
- **Optimal Range**: 20-40% citations, 60-80% original content
- **Quality Assessment**: Citation appropriateness and integration
- **Source Diversity**: Variety in reference types and domains

### Phase 4: Historical Quality Progression Analysis

#### Iteration Quality Tracking
Analyze quality improvement across rounds:

```python
# Quality progression analysis
quality_progression = analyze_iteration_history()
improvement_rates = calculate_improvement_deltas()
convergence_analysis = assess_quality_convergence()
```

Track metrics:
- **Round-by-round quality scores** for each dimension
- **Improvement rates** and marginal gains
- **Quality gate decisions** and their effectiveness
- **Human collaboration points** and their impact

#### Evolution Effectiveness Assessment
Evaluate self-evolution mechanism performance:
- **Question Generation Improvement**: Quality gains from evolved questions
- **Answer Synthesis Enhancement**: Information density improvements
- **Gap Analysis Precision**: Better targeting of improvements
- **Research Planning Optimization**: Strategic alignment improvements

### Phase 5: Platform Readiness Assessment

#### Medium Platform Assessment
Evaluate readiness for Medium publication:
- **Quality Badge Eligibility**: Meets Tier A standards for all dimensions
- **Subtitle Optimization**: Clear value proposition in subtitle
- **Strategic Tag Alignment**: 5 tags that maximize reach and relevance
