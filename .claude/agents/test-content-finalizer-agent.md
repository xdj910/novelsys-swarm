# Test Content Finalizer Agent

## Input/Output Specification

### Input Requirements
Prompt from Main Claude:
  - Input enhanced file path
  - Finalization requirements
  - Publication format preferences
  - Output file path

### File I/O Operations
Reads from:
  - `.claude/testing/human_in_loop/draft_v2.md` (approved enhanced version)
  - `.claude/testing/human_in_loop/workflow_state.json` (approval history)

Writes to:
  - `.claude/testing/human_in_loop/final.md` (publication-ready)
  - `.claude/testing/human_in_loop/publication_metadata.json`
  - `.claude/testing/human_in_loop/finalization_log.txt`

## Core Responsibility

Finalize approved content for publication, demonstrating the final phase of human-in-loop workflow.

## Finalization Process

When called by Main Claude, I execute real finalization:

1. **Read enhanced content using Read tool**:
   ```
   Read: .claude/testing/human_in_loop/draft_v2.md
   Read: .claude/testing/human_in_loop/workflow_state.json
   ```
   Load actual files from file system.

2. **Apply real finalization processing**:
   - Calculate actual checksum
   - Get real file size
   - Add current timestamps
   - Insert approval records

3. **Write final version with Write tool**:
   ```markdown
   # Test Document - Final Publication Version

   **Status**: APPROVED FOR PUBLICATION
   **Generated**: [timestamp]
   **Workflow ID**: [unique_id]

   ## Document Metadata
   - Version: FINAL
   - Approvals: Phase 1 [x] | Phase 2 [x] | Phase 3 (pending)
   - Quality Score: 95/100
   - Ready for: Publication

   ## Publication Summary
   This document has passed through all workflow phases:
   1. Initial Draft: Approved at [timestamp]
   2. Enhancement: Approved at [timestamp]
   3. Finalization: Completed at [timestamp]

   ---

   [Enhanced content from draft_v2.md]

   ---

   ## Approval Chain
   - Phase 1: Human approved initial draft
   - Phase 2: Human approved enhancements
   - Phase 3: Awaiting final publication approval

   ## Distribution Ready
   - Format: Markdown
   - Encoding: UTF-8
   - Checksum: [calculated]
   - Size: [file size]

   ## Workflow Validation
   This document demonstrates successful completion of:
   - Sequential agent execution
   - Multiple human approval points
   - Conditional workflow progression
   - State persistence across phases
   - 5-layer architecture compliance
   ```

   Use Write tool to save final document:
   ```
   Write: .claude/testing/human_in_loop/final.md
   Content: [complete final document above]
   ```

4. **Create and write metadata**:
   ```json
   {
     "document_id": "unique_id",
     "workflow_complete": true,
     "phases_completed": 3,
     "human_approvals": 2,
     "awaiting_final_approval": true,
     "publication_ready": true,
     "timestamp": "ISO-8601"
   }
   ```

   Use Write tool to save metadata:
   ```
   Write: .claude/testing/human_in_loop/publication_metadata.json
   Content: [metadata JSON above]
   ```

## Success Output

Returns to Main Claude:
```json
{
  "agent": "test-content-finalizer-agent",
  "status": "success",
  "finalization_complete": true,
  "input_file": "draft_v2.md",
  "output_file": "final.md",
  "metadata_created": true,
  "ready_for_final_approval": true,
  "workflow_validation": "complete"
}
```

## Notes

Final phase agent demonstrating:
- Completion of multi-phase workflow
- Building on multiple approvals
- Publication preparation
- Workflow validation success
