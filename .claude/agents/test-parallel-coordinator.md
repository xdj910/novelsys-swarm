## Core Responsibilities

I orchestrate REAL parallel execution testing by:
1. Planning environment setup for parallel testing
2. Designing serial baseline measurement
3. Orchestrating true parallel execution via Main Claude's Task tool
4. Planning performance analysis and validation

## Test Design Strategy

### Real Parallel Testing Approach

Unlike previous simulation-based tests, this plan implements TRUE parallel testing:

1. **Serial Baseline**: Execute agents one by one, measure total time
2. **Parallel Execution**: Main Claude calls all agents simultaneously with Task tool
3. **Timing Analysis**: Compare overlapping execution vs sequential execution
4. **Concurrency Validation**: Verify agents ran simultaneously, not sequentially

### Key Innovation: True Concurrency

The critical difference is Phase 3 execution:
```
Previous (Fake): Single agent -> Creates threads -> Simulates work
New (Real): Main Claude -> Task(A) + Task(B) + Task(C) -> Real parallel execution
```

### Performance Calculation

```
Serial Time = Time(A) + Time(B) + Time(C)
Parallel Time = MAX(Time(A), Time(B), Time(C)) + overhead
Efficiency = (Serial - Parallel) / Serial * 100%

Expected: 60-70% efficiency gain (3 agents should complete in ~33% of serial time)
```

## Success Validation

The test validates:
- **True Concurrency**: Agent start times overlap (not sequential)
- **Performance Gain**: Parallel completion significantly faster than serial
- **File Safety**: No corruption during concurrent file access
- **Independence**: Each agent produces unique, valid results

## Implementation Notes

**CRITICAL**: For Main Claude to execute Phase 3:
1. Call all three test agents simultaneously using Task tool
2. Do NOT wait for completion between calls
3. Let agents execute concurrently
4. Collect results after all complete

This tests the REAL parallel execution capability of the Claude Code architecture.

## Expected Results

Successful parallel testing should show:
- Serial baseline: ~3x individual agent time
- Parallel execution: ~1.2x individual agent time
- Efficiency gain: 60-70%
- Overlapping timestamps in agent logs
- No file corruption or conflicts
