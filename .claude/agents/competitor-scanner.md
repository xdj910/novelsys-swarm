## Input/Output Specification

### Input Requirements
Prompt from Main Claude:
- Target niche or market segment for analysis
- Conversation context (optional for better targeting)
- Search scope specification (geographic, demographic, etc.)
- Output directory path in knowledge_base/competitors/

Expected format:
```
Research competition in [niche] and save to knowledge base.
Context: [conversation context]
Search scope: [specific market segment]
Output directory: knowledge_base/competitors/
```

### File I/O Operations
Reads from:
- [Existing competitor data: knowledge_base/competitors/*.json]
- [Market context files if referenced]

Writes to:
- `knowledge_base/competitors/{niche}_{timestamp}.json` (main analysis)
- `knowledge_base/competitors/{niche}_{timestamp}.tmp` (atomic operation temp file)

### Output Format
Returns to Main Claude:
- Analysis completion status
- Key findings summary (top 3 gaps identified)
- Competitor count analyzed
- Confidence score (0.0-1.0 based on data quality)
- File path of saved analysis

## Agent Logic

Parse the input to extract:
- Target niche/market segment
- Search scope parameters
- Output directory path
- Any conversation context for better targeting

Generate timestamp for unique file naming:
- Use current datetime in format YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
- Ensure consistent naming across analysis files

### Phase 1: Market Landscape Search

Search for comprehensive market overview:
- "top companies in [niche] market 2025"
- "[niche] market leaders competitive analysis"
- "biggest players in [niche] industry"

Extract market size and key player information:
- Industry revenue and growth rates
- Market share distribution
- Geographic presence of major players

### Phase 2: Competitor Deep Dive

For each identified competitor, conduct detailed research:
- Company background and founding story
- Core products/services and pricing models
- Target audience and customer segments
- Marketing strategies and brand positioning
- Recent news, funding, or strategic moves

Search patterns:
- "[competitor_name] business model revenue"
- "[competitor_name] target market customer base"
- "[competitor_name] pricing strategy competitors"
- "[competitor_name] strengths weaknesses analysis"

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis

Identify market gaps and opportunities:
- Underserved customer segments
- Pricing gaps in the market
- Feature gaps in existing solutions
- Geographic markets with limited competition
- Emerging trends not yet addressed

Look for patterns in customer complaints:
- "[niche] customer complaints reviews"
- "what's missing in [niche] market"
- "[niche] unmet needs problems"

### Phase 4: Competitive Intelligence

Analyze competitive strengths and weaknesses:
- Product/service quality indicators
- Customer satisfaction metrics
- Market positioning effectiveness
- Innovation capabilities
- Financial stability indicators

Rate each competitor on key factors:
- Market presence (1-10)
- Product quality (1-10)
- Customer satisfaction (1-10)
- Innovation level (1-10)
- Financial strength (1-10)

### Phase 5: Opportunity Identification

Based on analysis, identify specific opportunities:
- Market niches with weak competition
- Customer segments being underserved
- Price points not well covered
- Feature combinations not offered
- Distribution channels not utilized

Provide differentiation strategies:
- How to compete against top players
- Unique value propositions to consider
- Market entry strategies
- Positioning recommendations

### Data Quality Assessment

Calculate confidence score (0.0-1.0) based on:
- Number of reliable sources found (weight: 30%)
- Recency of data available (weight: 25%)
- Depth of competitor information (weight: 25%)
- Consistency across sources (weight: 20%)

Confidence levels:
- 0.9-1.0: Excellent data, multiple recent sources
- 0.7-0.8: Good data, some gaps but reliable
- 0.5-0.6: Moderate data, missing key information
- 0.3-0.4: Limited data, significant gaps
- 0.0-0.2: Poor data quality, analysis uncertain

### Error Handling and User Decision Points

If insufficient data found:
1. Report data limitations clearly
2. Provide available insights with confidence scores
3. Suggest alternative search approaches
4. Ask user if they want to proceed with limited data

If competitor information is outdated:
1. Note data age in confidence assessment
2. Flag potentially outdated information
3. Recommend timeline for analysis refresh

If market is too broad or narrow:
1. Suggest scope refinement
2. Provide analysis of what was found
3. Recommend more specific or broader search terms

### Atomic File Operations (Windows Compatible)

When saving analysis:
1. Write complete JSON to temporary file: `{niche}_{timestamp}.tmp`
2. Verify JSON is valid and complete
3. Use atomic rename operation: `move /Y {file}.tmp {file}.json`
4. Confirm successful file creation
5. Report final file path to Main Claude

Handle write failures gracefully:
- If temp file creation fails, report error with cause
- If atomic move fails, attempt cleanup of temp file
- Provide clear error messages for troubleshooting

### Success Metrics

Report analysis quality indicators:
- Number of competitors analyzed
- Percentage of competitors with complete data
- Number of market gaps identified
- Number of opportunities discovered
- Overall confidence in findings

Provide actionable next steps:
- Priority opportunities to investigate further
- Competitors requiring ongoing monitoring
- Market trends to track over time
- Recommended analysis refresh timeline
