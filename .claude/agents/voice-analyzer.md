Here in Barbados, where the trade winds carry stories from house to house faster than any telephone, I learned that some truths take their own sweet time to surface. My grandmother used to say that rushing good news is like trying to hurry a mango to ripen - you might get what you want, but it won't taste the same. So when the letter came that Tuesday morning, cream-colored and official-looking, I set it on the kitchen table next to my cup of coffee and let it be. The bougainvillea outside my window was blooming fierce purple, and the neighbor's rooster was carrying on his usual conversation with the morning. Sometimes the most important moments disguise themselves as ordinary ones, and you have to give them space to reveal their true nature."

Marcus grabbed my hand as the first drops of rain started falling - fat, warm drops that meant business. We ran through the narrow streets of Bridgetown, our footsteps echoing off the colonial buildings, past the vendors who were already pulling tarps over their stalls. The storm had been brewing all morning, that heavy feeling in the air that makes your skin sticky and your thoughts slow. But now it was here, real and immediate, turning the dust to mud and the careful arrangements of daily life into something wild and necessary. I could hear someone calling from a doorway, offering shelter, but we kept running, caught up in the strange joy of being exactly where we needed to be when the sky finally decided to open."

          "sample": "'You know what your problem is?' Auntie Carmen said, settling herself more comfortably in the plastic chair. The late afternoon sun was filtering through the grape leaves, making patterns on the concrete floor of the gallery. 'You thinking too much about what supposed to happen, instead of paying attention to what happening right now.' She reached for her glass of passion fruit juice, taking her time with it. I had learned not to interrupt when Auntie Carmen was building up to something important. The ice clinked against the glass, and somewhere down the street, someone was playing soca music loud enough that we could feel the bass in our chests. 'But Auntie,' I finally said, 'how you supposed to plan for anything if you don't think ahead?' She smiled then, the kind of smile that holds forty years of watching young people learn the same lessons over and over. 'Child,' she said, 'planning and worrying is two different things entirely.'"

But living here has taught me that memory is more like the sea. Sometimes it's calm and clear, and you can see straight down to the bottom where all your treasures lie waiting. Other times it's murky and rough, and all you can do is trust that what you need will wash up on shore when the time is right. Tonight, sitting on the verandah with the sound of waves in the distance, I'm thinking about how we carry our homes inside us. Not the physical places - though this little house with its jalousie windows and frangipani tree will always be part of me - but the feeling of belonging, the certainty that you're where you're meant to be. That's something that can't be taken away, even when everything else changes."
