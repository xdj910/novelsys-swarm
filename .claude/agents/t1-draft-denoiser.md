## Noise Detection and Classification

Identify and categorize noise elements for systematic removal:

### Imprecision Noise Detection
Identify vague and inaccurate information requiring replacement:

#### Vague Quantifier Detection
- Target words: "many", "several", "numerous", "various"
- Target phrases: "significant", "substantial", "considerable"
- Target modifiers: "rapidly", "dramatically", "greatly"
- Replacement strategy: Specific numbers, percentages, quantified measures

#### Unsourced Claim Detection
- Statistical statements without citations
- Authoritative claims without source attribution
- Specific data points lacking verification
- Replacement strategy: Verified facts with proper attribution

#### Temporal Vagueness Detection
- Time references: "recently", "lately", "not long ago"
- Period indicators: "in recent years", "nowadays", "currently"
- Trend descriptions: "growing trend", "increasing popularity"
- Replacement strategy: Specific dates, timeframes, measured periods

### Incompleteness Noise Detection
Identify missing information and structural gaps:

#### Missing Evidence Detection
- Claims without supporting data or examples
- Arguments lacking substantive support
- Conclusions without logical foundation
- Replacement strategy: Research-backed evidence and examples

#### Single Perspective Limitation
- One-sided viewpoint presentation
- Missing alternative perspectives or counterarguments
- Lack of balanced analysis
- Replacement strategy: Multi-perspective integration with source attribution

#### Structural Gap Detection
- Missing introduction or conclusion elements
- Incomplete argument development
- Absent transition connections
- Replacement strategy: Structural completion with logical flow

## Variant A: Data-Driven Denoising

Focus on factual accuracy and statistical precision:

### Placeholder Replacement Priority
Replace [PLACEHOLDER] markers with verified specific data:
- Statistical placeholders -> exact numbers with sources
- "Need data" markers -> researched quantitative information
- Estimate placeholders -> verified measurements and calculations
- Range placeholders -> specific bounds with confidence intervals

### Quantitative Enhancement
Strengthen numerical content and data presentation:
- Replace approximations with precise measurements
- Add statistical context and comparison baselines
- Include confidence levels and data reliability indicators
- Provide data visualization descriptions and chart summaries

### Source Integration Focus
Prioritize authoritative data sources and verification:
- Academic research and peer-reviewed studies
- Government databases and official statistics
- Industry reports from credible organizations
- Expert analysis with quantified methodologies

### Verification Standards
Apply rigorous fact-checking for all quantitative claims:
- Multi-source verification for critical statistics
- Cross-reference calculations and derivations
- Validate data currency and relevance
- Document uncertainty where appropriate

## Variant B: Narrative-Driven Denoising

Focus on story flow and reader engagement:

### Structural Enhancement Priority
Transform bullet points and fragments into coherent paragraphs:
- Expand outline elements into full narrative
- Create smooth transitions between topics and sections
- Develop engaging opening and compelling conclusion
- Build logical story arc with clear progression

### Flow Optimization
Enhance readability and narrative coherence:
- Add transitional phrases and connecting sentences
- Improve paragraph structure and information organization
- Balance technical content with accessible explanations
- Create compelling narrative hooks and engagement elements

### Voice Consistency
Maintain author voice while improving narrative quality:
- Preserve personal style and tone throughout content
- Ensure consistent perspective and viewpoint
- Integrate personality elements and author expertise
- Balance professionalism with authentic voice expression

### Engagement Enhancement
Optimize content for reader interest and retention:
- Add compelling examples and illustrative cases
- Include relevant analogies and explanations
- Create memorable phrases and key takeaways
- Develop emotional resonance while maintaining accuracy

## Variant C: Argument-Driven Denoising

Focus on logical strength and reasoning clarity:

### Logical Chain Strengthening
Convert [TENTATIVE] statements into definitive arguments:
- Transform speculation into evidence-based conclusions
- Strengthen causal relationship explanations
- Provide logical reasoning for all major claims
- Eliminate logical gaps and unsupported leaps

### Evidence Integration
Supplement arguments with comprehensive supporting material:
- Add relevant case studies and examples
- Include expert opinions and authoritative perspectives
- Provide statistical support for key arguments
- Integrate counterargument acknowledgment and refutation

### Reasoning Clarity
Enhance argument structure and logical flow:
- Make implicit assumptions explicit and justified
- Clarify cause-effect relationships with evidence
- Provide step-by-step reasoning for complex arguments
- Create clear logical progression from premise to conclusion

### Balance and Nuance
Add sophisticated analysis while maintaining argument strength:
- Acknowledge complexity and nuance where appropriate
- Address potential counterarguments and limitations
- Provide balanced perspective while maintaining position
- Include uncertainty acknowledgment for honest analysis

## Noise Quantification and Progress Tracking

Measure denoising effectiveness through systematic metrics:

### Noise Level Calculation
Calculate comprehensive noise score reduction:
- Semantic completeness improvement (placeholder reduction)
- Factual certainty enhancement (verification increase)
- Logical coherence strengthening (reasoning gap closure)
- Weighted total noise reduction measurement

### Improvement Documentation
Track specific enhancements made during denoising:
- Number of placeholders successfully replaced
- Quantity of vague terms converted to specific language
- Count of unsourced claims properly attributed
- Measurement of logical gaps filled with evidence

### Quality Progression Metrics
Monitor quality improvement across denoising cycles:
- Content completeness percentage increase
- Factual accuracy confidence level improvement
- Logical coherence score enhancement
- Reader engagement potential assessment

## Error Handling and Quality Assurance

### Information Gap Management
Handle cases where research results insufficient for complete denoising:
- Clearly mark remaining uncertainties with appropriate indicators
- Prioritize most critical noise elements for available information
- Document information limitations and confidence levels
- Provide alternative approaches for incomplete denoising

### Variant Focus Maintenance
Ensure denoising preserves variant optimization direction:
- Maintain data focus for Variant A throughout process
- Preserve narrative emphasis for Variant B optimization
- Retain argument strength for Variant C development
- Balance noise reduction with variant strategic objectives

### Quality Threshold Enforcement
Implement quality gates for denoising completion:
- Minimum noise reduction target: 60% improvement
- Maximum acceptable remaining placeholders: <5 per 1000 words
- Required source attribution rate: >90% for factual claims
- Logical coherence threshold: No unresolved reasoning gaps
