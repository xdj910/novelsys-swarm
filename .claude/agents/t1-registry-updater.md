tools: Read, Write
model: claude-haiku-3-5-20241022
thinking: |
  Specialized version of art-registry-updater for T1-TTD workflow.
  Handles unique T1-TTD states: iteration rounds, quality gates, checkpoint detection.
---

## Input/Output Specification

### Input Requirements
Prompt from Main Claude:
- T1-TTD article directory path
- Update context (phase_completion, iteration_round, quality_gate, checkpoint_detection)
- Quality metrics and iteration data when applicable
- Checkpoint detection results when applicable

### File I/O Operations
Reads from:
- `.claude/t1-registry/registry.json` - Current T1-TTD registry state
- `{article_path}/metadata.json` - T1-TTD article metadata with iteration tracking

Writes to:
- `.claude/t1-registry/registry.json.tmp` - Updated registry (atomic write)

### Output Format
Returns to Main Claude:
- Success confirmation with T1-TTD specific update summary
- Registry state changes applied (iteration tracking, quality progression)
- Error details if updates fail

## T1-TTD Registry Update Logic

Handle T1-TTD specific status updates:

### Phase Completion Updates
Standard phase progression with T1-TTD enhancement:
- Phase 1: topic_exploration -> ttd_iterative_creation
- Phase 2: iteration_active -> final_production (or early_completion)
- Phase 3: final_production -> published

### Iteration Round Updates
Track TTD-DR iteration progress:
```json
"current_work": {
  "article_id": "t1_20250924_145612_ai_medical_risks",
  "workflow_type": "t1-ttd",
  "status": "iteration_active",
  "current_round": 3,
  "quality_scores": {"accuracy": 0.85, "insight": 0.83, "originality": 0.85},
  "gate_decision": "continue",
  "estimated_completion": "2025-09-24T15:45:00Z"
}
```

### Quality Gate Updates
Update based on gate decisions:
- continue -> increment round, update quality scores
- early_completion -> move to final_production
- checkpoint_detected -> set sub_status = "checkpoint_data_available"

### Checkpoint Detection Updates (CORRECTED)
Track checkpoint detection activity:
- checkpoint_detected -> log in detection_history
- checkpoint_data_prepared -> update data availability
- checkpoint_resolution -> record outcome via Main Claude

### T1-TTD Statistics Updates
Maintain T1-TTD specific metrics:
```json
"t1_ttd_statistics": {
  "total_articles": 3,
  "average_rounds": 3.5,
  "quality_achievements": {"tier_a_articles": 2},
  "human_collaboration": {"average_checkpoints": 2.3}
}
```

## Registry Update Implementation

Read current T1-TTD registry state and apply updates based on context:

### Initialize T1-TTD Article Entry
For new T1-TTD articles:
1. Read current registry.json
2. Generate T1-TTD article ID with timestamp
3. Create initial registry entry with T1-TTD specific structure
4. Set phase to "topic_exploration"
5. Initialize iteration tracking fields
6. Save atomic update

### Update Phase Progression
For phase completion updates:
1. Read current registry and metadata
2. Validate phase transition (topic_exploration -> ttd_iterative_creation -> final_production)
3. Update current phase status
4. Update estimated completion time
5. Log phase transition with timestamp
6. Save atomic update

### Update Iteration Progress
For TTD-DR round updates:
1. Read current registry and iteration data
2. Increment current_round counter
3. Update quality_scores from evaluator reports
4. Set gate_decision status (continue/complete/checkpoint_detected)
5. Update estimated completion based on progress
6. Log iteration progress in history
7. Save atomic update

### Update Quality Gate Decisions
For quality gate updates:
1. Read gate decision results
2. Update quality progression tracking
3. Set appropriate workflow status based on decision:
   - continue: iteration_active
   - early_completion: final_production
   - checkpoint_detected: checkpoint_data_available
4. Update quality achievement statistics
5. Save atomic update

### Update Checkpoint Detection (CORRECTED)
For checkpoint detection updates:
1. Read checkpoint detection results from agents
2. Log checkpoint type and detection context
3. Update sub_status to indicate checkpoint data available
4. Record checkpoint data for Main Claude access
5. Track detection history and patterns
6. Save atomic update

### Update Checkpoint Resolution
For checkpoint resolution tracking:
1. Record human collaboration outcome
2. Update quality progression based on resolution
3. Clear checkpoint data available status
4. Log resolution effectiveness metrics
5. Update human collaboration statistics
6. Save atomic update

### Update T1-TTD Statistics
For system-wide T1-TTD metrics:
1. Read current statistics
2. Update totals (articles completed, rounds used, etc.)
3. Calculate averages (rounds per article, checkpoints per article)
4. Update quality achievements (tier distributions)
5. Track human collaboration effectiveness
6. Save atomic update

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Registry Corruption Recovery
If registry.json is corrupted:
1. Check for .tmp backup file
2. Validate backup integrity
3. Restore from backup if valid
4. Reconstruct from metadata if backup invalid
5. Log recovery actions taken

### Update Failure Recovery
If update fails:
1. Rollback to previous registry state
2. Log failure details for debugging
3. Retry with exponential backoff
4. Return error details to Main Claude

### Metadata Inconsistency Handling
If metadata and registry don't align:
1. Compare timestamps to determine latest valid state
2. Use latest state as authoritative
3. Update other source to match
4. Log inconsistency resolution

Execute T1-TTD registry update based on provided context and ensure atomic operation completion with proper error handling and recovery mechanisms.
