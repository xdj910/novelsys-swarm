## Multi-Strategy Synthesis Generation

Generate 3 different synthesis approaches for optimal quality comparison:

### Strategy 1: Evidence Aggregation
Focus on factual information combination and verification:
- Systematically combine multiple source data points
- Cross-verify statistics and quantitative claims
- Maintain clear attribution for each fact
- Prioritize authoritative and recent sources
- Structure information by evidence strength
- Create comprehensive fact base with verification levels

### Strategy 2: Narrative Integration
Focus on coherent storytelling and information flow:
- Weave information into engaging narrative structure
- Create smooth transitions between different topics
- Develop compelling opening and conclusion
- Use storytelling techniques to enhance readability
- Balance factual density with accessibility
- Optimize for reader engagement and comprehension

### Strategy 3: Analytical Synthesis
Focus on pattern extraction and insight generation:
- Identify underlying patterns across multiple sources
- Extract higher-level insights from raw data
- Create analytical frameworks for understanding
- Synthesize cause-effect relationships
- Generate novel connections between disparate information
- Focus on analytical depth and intellectual value

## Comprehensive Quality Evaluation

For each synthesis candidate, calculate detailed quality metrics:

### Information Density Assessment (25% weight)
Evaluate factual content concentration and efficiency:
- Count verifiable facts per word ratio
- Optimal range: 1 fact per 20-30 words
- Penalty for too sparse (<0.5x optimal) or dense (>1.5x optimal)
- Bonus for precise numerical data and specific details
- Assessment of information utility and relevance
- Target score range: 0.0-1.0

### Source Integration Assessment (20% weight)
Evaluate effectiveness of source material utilization:
- Citation quality and accuracy verification
- Source diversity across different domains and perspectives
- Conflicting information handling and resolution
- Attribution accuracy and completeness
- Source credibility and authority assessment
- Cross-reference validation between sources
- Target score range: 0.0-1.0

### Factual Coherence Assessment (25% weight)
Evaluate logical consistency and factual accuracy:
- Internal consistency across all statements
- Absence of contradictions within synthesized content
- Logical flow and reasoning chain integrity
- Fact verification against multiple sources
- Uncertainty acknowledgment where appropriate
- Confidence levels for different types of claims
- Target score range: 0.0-1.0

### Relevance Assessment (20% weight)
Evaluate connection to research questions and gaps:
- Direct addressing of identified research questions
- Coverage of information gaps from gap analysis
- Alignment with content improvement objectives
- Utility for draft enhancement purposes
- Strategic value for overall article quality
- Target score range: 0.0-1.0

### Completeness Assessment (10% weight)
Evaluate comprehensive coverage of available information:
- Utilization rate of available source materials
- Coverage of all relevant aspects identified in questions
- Balance between depth and breadth
- Missing information identification and acknowledgment
- Research question fulfillment percentage
- Target score range: 0.0-1.0

## Historical Performance Integration

Weight current performance with historical strategy effectiveness:
- Current cycle score: 70% weight
- Historical performance average: 30% weight
- Strategy-specific learning and improvement tracking
- Adaptive weighting based on strategy success patterns

## Optimal Strategy Selection

Select single best synthesis approach using comprehensive evaluation:

### Performance Scoring
Calculate weighted total score for each strategy combining:
- Current quality assessment across all dimensions
- Historical performance data for strategy type
- Context-specific effectiveness indicators

### Strategy Effectiveness Tracking
Maintain performance history for each synthesis strategy:
- Evidence Aggregation: Track factual accuracy and density achievements
- Narrative Integration: Track readability and engagement metrics
- Analytical Synthesis: Track insight generation and depth scores

### Selection Reasoning Documentation
Document selection rationale including:
- Quantified quality scores for all strategies
- Historical performance considerations
- Context-specific factors influencing choice
- Alternative strategy scores and use cases

## Evolution Convergence Detection

Implement sophisticated termination criteria:

### Quality Ceiling Detection
If best strategy achieves score >0.94, consider optimal synthesis reached.

### Improvement Plateau
If synthesis quality improvement <0.02 for 2 consecutive cycles, terminate evolution.

### Strategy Convergence
If same strategy selected for 3 consecutive cycles with <0.01 score variance, converged.

### Resource Optimization
Maximum 4 evolution cycles to balance quality with efficiency requirements.

## Content Analysis and Metrics

Provide detailed content analysis for selected synthesis:

### Quantitative Analysis
- Word count and content length optimization
- Fact count and information density calculation
- Source diversity assessment across domains
- Citation completeness and accuracy verification

### Qualitative Analysis
- Uncertainty handling and transparency assessment
- Information confidence level distribution
- Content coherence and flow evaluation
- Integration effectiveness across source materials

### Strategic Analysis
- Research question fulfillment assessment
- Gap coverage and information completeness
- Content utility for draft improvement
- Quality progression tracking across evolution cycles

## Advanced Source Management

Implement sophisticated source integration:

### Multi-Source Verification
Cross-verify claims across multiple independent sources with confidence scoring.

### Conflict Resolution
Handle contradictory information through transparent annotation and context provision.

### Authority Assessment
Evaluate and weight sources based on credibility, recency, and domain expertise.

### Attribution Optimization
Maintain precise attribution while optimizing content flow and readability.

## Status Integration

Write evolution status to:
- `evolution/answer_synthesis/evolution_status_v{n}.json` - Evolution progress tracking
- `evolution/answer_synthesis/synthesis_candidates_v{n}.json` - All synthesis attempts
- `evolution/answer_synthesis/strategy_performance_v{n}.json` - Strategy effectiveness tracking

Status updates should include:
- Evolution cycle start/end timestamps
- Synthesis candidate generation progress
- Quality scores for each strategy
- Strategy selection reasoning and performance metrics
- Source integration and verification results
- Performance metrics collection

## Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

### Synthesis Generation Failure
If unable to generate all 3 synthesis strategies, use simplified 2-strategy approach with modified evaluation.

### Quality Evaluation Failure
If comprehensive metrics fail, fall back to basic information density and coherence assessment.

### Source Integration Issues
If source materials are insufficient, clearly document limitations and confidence levels.

### Evolution System Failure
If self-evolution fails, generate single optimized synthesis using best available strategy.

## Performance Targets and Expectations

Quality improvement targets through self-evolution:
- Information density: +30% through optimized fact integration
- Source integration: +25% through advanced attribution and verification
- Factual coherence: +35% through systematic consistency checking
- Overall synthesis quality: 25-40% improvement to 0.88-0.98 range

Efficiency targets:
- 2-3 evolution cycles typical for convergence
- 3-4 minutes total processing time including evaluation
- Measurable quality improvements within iteration limits
- Consistent performance across diverse content types

## Implementation Notes

This agent represents the critical synthesis component of the TTD-DR methodology, transforming raw research into integrated, coherent content through advanced self-evolution optimization.

The multi-strategy approach ensures optimal synthesis selection based on content requirements, while comprehensive quality evaluation provides measurable improvement tracking.

Integration with source verification and conflict resolution ensures factual accuracy while maintaining content coherence and readability for effective draft enhancement.
