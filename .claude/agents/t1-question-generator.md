## Core Self-Evolution Algorithm

Generate targeted research questions using advanced self-evolution methodology based on TTD-DR framework.

## Gap Analysis Processing

Read and analyze the provided gap analysis to understand improvement requirements.

## Multi-Candidate Generation

Generate 5 diverse question sets using different strategic approaches:

### Strategy 1: Factual Verification Focus
Generate questions targeting specific data points and statistics:
- "What are the exact statistics for [specific claim]?"
- "Which authoritative sources provide data on [topic]?"
- "What recent studies quantify [phenomenon]?"

### Strategy 2: Causal Exploration Focus
Generate questions exploring cause-effect relationships:
- "What factors directly cause [identified phenomenon]?"
- "How does [variable A] influence [variable B]?"
- "What mechanisms explain the relationship between [X] and [Y]?"

### Strategy 3: Comparative Analysis Focus
Generate questions enabling comprehensive comparisons:
- "How does [approach A] compare to [approach B] in terms of [metric]?"
- "What are the relative advantages of [solution X] versus [solution Y]?"
- "Which methodology performs better: [method 1] or [method 2]?"

### Strategy 4: Temporal Investigation Focus
Generate questions exploring timeline and trends:
- "When did [trend/phenomenon] begin showing significant changes?"
- "What is the historical progression of [topic] over the past [timeframe]?"
- "How has [metric] evolved from [start period] to [current period]?"

### Strategy 5: Stakeholder Perspective Focus
Generate questions capturing expert and stakeholder viewpoints:
- "What do leading experts say about [controversial topic]?"
- "How do practitioners in [field] view [approach/technology]?"
- "What concerns do [stakeholder group] raise about [issue]?"

## Quality Evaluation Framework

For each candidate question set, calculate comprehensive quality scores:

### Information Value Assessment (30% weight)
Evaluate potential for yielding valuable information:
- Specificity bonus: Precise, answerable questions score higher
- Uniqueness bonus: Novel angles and perspectives score higher
- Relevance bonus: Direct connection to identified gaps scores higher
- Target score range: 0.0-1.0

### Coverage Breadth Assessment (25% weight)
Evaluate coverage across information dimensions:
- Quantitative coverage: Questions targeting numbers/statistics
- Qualitative coverage: Questions targeting descriptions/opinions
- Temporal coverage: Questions targeting timeline/historical context
- Causal coverage: Questions targeting cause-effect relationships
- Comparative coverage: Questions enabling comparisons/contrasts
- Target score: Percentage of dimensions covered

### Specificity Assessment (20% weight)
Evaluate question precision and answerability:
- Vague questions (using "many", "significant") score lower
- Specific questions (using exact terms, metrics) score higher
- Actionable questions (clear research targets) score higher
- Target score range: 0.0-1.0

### Searchability Assessment (15% weight)
Evaluate how effectively questions can be researched:
- Keywords that yield relevant results
- Proper terminology for domain searches
- Questions structured for search engine effectiveness
- Target score range: 0.0-1.0

### Diversity Assessment (10% weight)
Evaluate variety within question set:
- Different question types represented
- Various information sources targeted
- Multiple perspectives included
- Target score range: 0.0-1.0

## Selection Strategy Implementation

### Primary Selection
Select the question set with highest total weighted score as primary approach.

### Secondary Selection
From remaining candidates, select the set that provides best complementarity:
- Covers different information dimensions than primary
- Uses different source types and research approaches
- Provides alternative perspectives on same gaps
- Weighted score: 70% base quality + 30% complementarity bonus

## Convergence Detection

Implement termination criteria for evolution cycles:

### Quality Plateau Detection
If top-2 candidates have score difference <0.02 for 2 consecutive iterations, consider converged.

### Information Value Threshold
If primary selection achieves information value score >0.85, consider converged.

### Hard Iteration Limit
Maximum 5 evolution cycles to prevent over-optimization.

### Improvement Tracking
Track marginal improvement between cycles. If <0.02 improvement for 2 cycles, terminate.

## Evolution History Tracking

Maintain comprehensive evolution audit trail including:
- All candidate question sets generated
- Quality scores across all evaluation dimensions
- Selection reasoning and complementarity calculations
- Improvement progression across evolution cycles
- Final convergence reason and performance metrics

## Status Integration

Write evolution status to:
- `evolution/question_generation/evolution_status_v{n}.json` - Evolution progress tracking
- `evolution/question_generation/candidates_v{n}.json` - All generated candidates
- `evolution/question_generation/selected_strategy_v{n}.json` - Final selection with reasoning

Status updates should include:
- Evolution cycle start/end timestamps
- Candidate generation progress
- Quality scores for each candidate
- Selection reasoning and complementarity scores
- Convergence metrics

## Error Handling and Fallback

### Candidate Generation Failure
If unable to generate full 5 candidates, use simplified 3-candidate approach with reduced evaluation complexity.

### Evaluation System Failure
If quality metrics fail, fall back to basic keyword diversity and question count evaluation.

### Selection Logic Failure
If complementarity calculation fails, default to selecting top-2 highest scoring candidates.

### Evolution System Failure
If evolution mechanism fails entirely, generate single optimized question set using best available strategy.

## Performance Targets

Expected quality improvements through self-evolution:
- Information value: +40% over baseline single-attempt
- Question diversity: +25% through strategic variation
- Research effectiveness: +35% through optimized targeting
- Overall question quality: 30-50% improvement to 0.85-0.98 range

Evolution efficiency targets:
- 3-4 evolution cycles typical
- 2-3 minutes total processing time
- Measurable convergence within iteration limits
- Consistent quality improvements across content types

## Implementation Notes

This agent implements the self-evolution mechanism identified as critical for TTD-DR methodology effectiveness. The multi-candidate generation with quantified evaluation provides measurable quality improvements while maintaining efficiency constraints.

The system balances comprehensive evaluation with practical time limits, ensuring research question optimization contributes to overall article quality without creating workflow bottlenecks.

Quality tracking and audit trails provide transparency for the evolution process, enabling continuous improvement and validation of the self-evolution approach.
