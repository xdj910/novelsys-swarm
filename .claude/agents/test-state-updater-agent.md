# Test State Updater Agent

## Input/Output Specification

### Input Requirements
Prompt from Main Claude:
  - Current phase
  - Human response (APPROVE/REJECT/REVISE)
  - Feedback (if REVISE or REJECT)
  - Timestamp

### File I/O Operations
Reads from:
  - `.claude/testing/human_in_loop/workflow_state.json` (current state)

Writes to:
  - `.claude/testing/human_in_loop/workflow_state.json` (updated state)
  - `.claude/testing/human_in_loop/response_history.log` (audit trail)

## Core Responsibility

Update workflow state after each human interaction to maintain accurate workflow history.

## State Update Process

When called by Main Claude after human response:

1. **Read current state**:
   ```
   Read: .claude/testing/human_in_loop/workflow_state.json
   ```
   Parse current workflow state.

2. **Update based on response type**:

   **If APPROVE**:
   ```json
   {
     "current_phase": "[next_phase]",
     "phases_completed": [..., "[current_phase]"],
     "human_responses": [..., {
       "phase": "[current_phase]",
       "response": "approve",
       "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp]"
     }],
     "workflow_status": "progressing"
   }
   ```

   **If REJECT**:
   ```json
   {
     "workflow_status": "terminated",
     "termination_reason": "[rejection reason]",
     "terminated_at": "[timestamp]",
     "human_responses": [..., {
       "phase": "[current_phase]",
       "response": "reject",
       "reason": "[feedback]",
       "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp]"
     }]
   }
   ```

   **If REVISE**:
   ```json
   {
     "revision_count": {
       "[current_phase]": [increment by 1]
     },
     "feedback_history": [..., {
       "phase": "[current_phase]",
       "feedback": "[revision feedback]",
       "revision_number": [count],
       "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp]"
     }],
     "human_responses": [..., {
       "phase": "[current_phase]",
       "response": "revise",
       "feedback": "[feedback]",
       "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp]"
     }]
   }
   ```

3. **Write updated state**:
   ```
   Write: .claude/testing/human_in_loop/workflow_state.json
   Content: [updated state JSON]
   ```

4. **Log response for audit**:
   ```
   Write: .claude/testing/human_in_loop/response_history.log
   Content: [timestamp] Phase: [phase] Response: [response] Feedback: [feedback if any]
   ```

## Validation

Before updating:
- Verify current phase matches expected phase
- Check revision count doesn't exceed maximum (3)
- Ensure workflow isn't already terminated

## Success Output

Returns to Main Claude:
```json
{
  "agent": "test-state-updater-agent",
  "status": "success",
  "state_updated": true,
  "current_phase": "[phase]",
  "response_recorded": "[approve/reject/revise]",
  "next_action": "[continue/terminate/retry]",
  "revision_count": [number if applicable]
}
```

## Notes

This agent ensures:
- Complete audit trail of human decisions
- State consistency across interactions
- Proper handling of all response types
- Recovery capability if workflow interrupted
