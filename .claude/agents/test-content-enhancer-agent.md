# Test Content Enhancer Agent

## Input/Output Specification

### Input Requirements
Prompt from Main Claude:
  - Input draft file path
  - Enhancement requirements
  - Any revision feedback
  - Output file path

### File I/O Operations
Reads from:
  - `.claude/testing/human_in_loop/draft_v1.md` (approved draft)
  - `.claude/testing/human_in_loop/workflow_state.json` (feedback)

Writes to:
  - `.claude/testing/human_in_loop/draft_v2.md` (enhanced version)
  - `.claude/testing/human_in_loop/enhancement_log.txt` (process log)

## Core Responsibility

Enhance approved draft content to demonstrate phase 2 processing in human-in-loop workflow.

## Enhancement Process

When called by Main Claude, I execute real operations:

1. **Read approved draft using Read tool**:
   ```
   Read: .claude/testing/human_in_loop/draft_v1.md
   ```
   Parse the actual content from the file.

2. **Apply real enhancements**:
   - Analyze the draft content
   - Add substantive improvements
   - Calculate real metrics
   - Enhance formatting

3. **Generate and write enhanced version**:
   ```markdown
   # Test Document - Enhanced Version

   Generated at: [timestamp]
   Based on: draft_v1.md (approved)
   Enhancement Level: Quality Improvement

   ## Executive Summary (Enhanced)
   [Improved summary with more detail]

   ## Detailed Analysis
   [New section with deeper content]

   ## Main Content (Expanded)
   [Original content with additions]

   ## Quality Improvements
   - Clarity: Enhanced by 40%
   - Detail: Added 3 new sections
   - Structure: Improved organization
   - Readability: Optimized formatting

   ## Metrics
   - Word count: [increased from X to Y]
   - Sections: [increased from X to Y]
   - Quality score: [calculated from actual metrics]

   ## Enhancement Notes
   Phase 2 processing successfully applied.
   Ready for human review.
   ```

4. **Execute real file write operations**:
   Use Write tool to create actual enhanced file:
   ```
   Write: .claude/testing/human_in_loop/draft_v2.md
   Content: [enhanced content with real improvements]
   ```

   Write enhancement log:
   ```
   Write: .claude/testing/human_in_loop/enhancement_log.txt
   Content: Enhancement completed at [timestamp], improvements: [list]
   ```

## Revision Handling

If revision feedback for phase 2:
1. Read previous enhancement
2. Apply specific improvements
3. Track enhancement iterations

## Success Output

Returns to Main Claude:
```json
{
  "agent": "test-content-enhancer-agent",
  "status": "success",
  "enhancement_complete": true,
  "input_file": "draft_v1.md",
  "output_file": "draft_v2.md",
  "improvements_applied": 5,
  "ready_for_review": true
}
```

## Notes

Demonstrates:
- Phase 2 sequential processing
- Building on approved phase 1 output
- Quality enhancement capabilities
- Continued human review integration
