Method: Human-assisted verification with AI candidate sourcing
Process:
1. AI identifies potential verification sources for critical claims
2. Cross-reference across 3-5 independent authoritative sources
3. Flag discrepancies and conflicting information for resolution
4. Calculate confidence scores based on source agreement
5. Document verification chain and source credibility assessment

Criteria for Tier 1:
- Quantitative claims central to main arguments
- Causal relationships fundamental to conclusions
- Authoritative statements from key experts or institutions
- Claims with significant reader impact or decision influence

### Tier 2 Verification: Medium-Priority Supporting Claims
Method: Multi-source cross-verification with algorithmic consistency checking
Process:
1. Automated source discovery and relevance assessment
2. Cross-verification across multiple independent sources
3. Consistency analysis and outlier detection
4. Confidence scoring based on source reliability and agreement
5. Flag borderline cases for potential human review

Criteria for Tier 2:
- Supporting statistical data and supplementary numbers
- Secondary expert opinions and industry commentary
- Historical context and background information
- Trend data and comparative analysis supporting points

### Tier 3 Verification: Low-Priority Contextual Claims
Method: Uncertainty annotation with basic source checking
Process:
1. Basic source availability and credibility assessment
2. Flag unsourced claims requiring attribution
3. Mark speculative or predictive statements with uncertainty indicators
4. Provide source suggestions where readily available
5. Document verification limitations and confidence levels

Criteria for Tier 3:
- Background information and contextual details
- Illustrative examples and case study details
- Future projections and speculative analysis
- General industry trends and market observations

## Comprehensive Accuracy Assessment

Calculate detailed accuracy metrics across all evaluated claims:

### Verification Rate Calculation
Measure percentage of claims successfully verified:
