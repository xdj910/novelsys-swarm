# IMAGE 1: ARTICLE COVER
*Critical for platform engagement*

## Purpose & Placement
**Why Needed**: First impression, sets skeptical/analytical tone, drives clicks
**Article Placement**: Header/hero image
**Supporting**: Opening hook about [specific topic]

## Platform Requirements vs Reality

| Platform | Required Size | Banana Output | Post-Processing |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Beehiiv | 1920x1200 (16:10) | Likely 1024x1024 (1:1) | Extend canvas + AI fill edges |
| Medium | Flexible, prefers wide | 1024x1024 | Use as-is or crop to 16:9 |
| Substack | 600x600 email + social | 1024x1024 | Crop center 600x600 |

## Visual Specifications
- **Mood**: Professional concern without panic
- **Color Palette**: Navy blue (trust), red accents (warning), white space
- **Style Reference**: McKinsey report meets Bloomberg terminal
- **Composition**: Wide scene that also works when cropped square
- **Critical Elements**: [Specific elements from article]

## Gemini/Banana Prompt

### Primary Prompt (Request Landscape)
```
A sophisticated business visualization depicting [specific scene from article]. The scene unfolds in a wide cinematic 16:10 landscape format, specifically 1920 pixels wide by 1200 pixels tall, perfect for article headers. [Continue with 150+ word narrative description including all visual elements, atmosphere, specific data points from article]. The composition is designed in an ultra-wide landscape format to capture the full scope of [specific issue]. Please generate this as a wide landscape banner image, not square. The image must work as a 16:10 aspect ratio header image. Absolutely no text, numbers, or logos should appear in the image.
```

### Fallback Prompt (If Square Output)
```
[Adjusted composition that works in square format, centered subject matter that won't lose critical elements when extended]
```

## Post-Processing Instructions

### If Banana Outputs Square (Likely):
1. **Open in Canva/Photoshop**
2. **Extend canvas to 1920x1200**
3. **Use AI generative fill for edges** (usually architectural/abstract elements)
4. **Ensure main subject remains centered**
5. **Export at highest quality**

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Main subject visible in center 600x600 (for Substack crop)
- [ ] Extended edges look natural
- [ ] Colors match AI Realist brand
- [ ] No text or numbers visible
- [ ] Professional, not decorative

# IMAGE 2: ROI COMPARISON CHART
*Supporting paragraph about 73% failure rate*

## Purpose & Placement
**Why Needed**: Visualizes shocking gap between AI promises and reality
**Article Placement**: After 3rd paragraph in "The Numbers Don't Lie" section
**Supporting Quote**: "While vendors promise 300% ROI, our analysis shows 12% average"

## Platform Requirements vs Reality

| Platform | Ideal Format | Banana Output | Post-Processing |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| All | Square is fine | 1024x1024 | Resize to 800x800 for faster loading |

## Visual Specifications
- **Type**: Bar chart comparison
- **Data Points**: Expected ROI (300%) vs Actual ROI (12%)
- **Color Coding**: Green (promise) vs Red (reality)
- **Style**: Clean, minimal, Bloomberg-style

## Gemini/Banana Prompt

```
A pristine business intelligence dashboard showing a dramatic comparison between AI investment promises and reality. The visualization features two prominent bars in a clean chart: the left bar stretches upward representing "Expected Returns" at a towering height suggesting 300% ROI, rendered in optimistic green. The right bar, labeled conceptually as "Actual Returns," barely rises to 12% of the left bar's height, shown in sobering red. The stark height difference creates immediate visual impact. Surrounding data widgets hint at cost overruns and timeline delays through downward trending lines and warning indicators. The entire composition uses a navy blue and orange color scheme against a light gray background, mimicking high-end platforms like Tableau or PowerBI. The style is minimal and professional, suitable for a boardroom presentation. Generate as a square image perfect for inline article placement. No text, numbers, or labels should be readable.
```

## Processing Notes
- Banana handles simple compositions well
- Square format usually succeeds
- May need to adjust color balance for brand consistency

# Production Workflow

## Step 1: Generate Images (15 min)
1. Copy each prompt to Gemini web interface
2. Generate 2-3 variations maximum
3. Download best at highest resolution
4. Save originals before processing

## Step 2: Post-Processing (10-20 min)
1. Extend covers to 1920x1200 if needed
2. Adjust colors for brand consistency
3. Optimize file sizes (target <500KB)
4. Create platform-specific versions

## Step 3: Quality Assurance
- [ ] Cover works at all platform sizes
- [ ] Data visualizations are clear
- [ ] Brand consistency maintained
- [ ] No text/number artifacts
- [ ] Files optimized for web

## Budget & Time

- **Generation**: 3-4 images x $0.039 = ~$0.15
- **Time**: 15 min generation + 15 min processing = 30 min total
- **Tools Needed**: Gemini access + Basic image editor

## Success Metrics

Good visual production should:
- Increase click-through rate by 133% (per data)
- Support article's skeptical positioning
- Look professional without being generic
- Work across all platforms with minimal adjustment

## Key Principles for Guide Creation

1. **Justify Every Image**: Explain WHY it's needed, WHAT argument it supports
2. **Be Realistic**: Document what Banana will likely produce vs what's needed
3. **Bridge the Gap**: Provide specific instructions for post-processing
4. **Think Holistically**: Consider the entire production workflow
5. **Platform-Specific**: Address each platform's unique requirements

## Article Analysis Methodology

When analyzing the article:
1. **Map Visual Moments**: Find 2-3 places where images add maximum value
2. **Extract Specific Data**: Pull exact statistics that need visualization
3. **Identify Emotional Beats**: Where should reader feel concern/relief/understanding
4. **Match to Templates**: Warning/Analysis/Solution visual styles
5. **Consider Practical Limits**: What Banana can realistically produce
