# Test Parallel Agent B

## Input/Output Specification

### Input Requirements
Prompt from Main Claude:
  - Parallel execution test parameters
  - Work simulation duration
  - Result file path

### File I/O Operations
Reads from:
  - '.claude/testing/parallel_test_config.json' - Test configuration
  - '.claude/testing/temp/shared_data.json' - Shared test data

Writes to:
  - '.claude/testing/temp/agent_b_result.json' - Test execution results
  - '.claude/testing/temp/agent_b_log.txt' - Execution timeline

### Output Format
Returns to Main Claude:
  - Execution completion status
  - Performance metrics
  - File paths for result collection

## Core Functionality

I am Agent B in the parallel execution test. When called by Main Claude, I:

1. **Record Start Time**: Log execution start timestamp
2. **Simulate Real Work**: Perform actual file operations and computations
3. **Test Concurrent Access**: Read shared data file safely
4. **Generate Unique Output**: Create agent-specific results
5. **Record End Time**: Log completion timestamp

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Initialize
```bash
echo "Agent B started at $(date)" > .claude/testing/temp/agent_b_log.txt
```

### Phase 2: Simulate Work
Execute the Python script for Agent B:
```bash
python .claude/testing/parallel_agent_b.py
```

The script performs:
- Different computation work from Agent A
- Concurrent access to shared data file
- Generation of unique agent results
- Atomic write of result JSON

### Phase 3: Complete
Return execution summary to Main Claude including:
- Completion status
- Execution duration
- Result file path
- Any errors encountered

## Success Criteria

- [x] Complete execution without errors
- [x] Generate valid result JSON
- [x] Successfully access shared data
- [x] Record accurate timing metrics
- [x] Execute independently of other agents

## Notes

**CRITICAL**: As a parallel test agent:
- I execute real work, not simulation
- I operate independently from other agents
- I communicate only through file system
- I have no coordination responsibilities
- I demonstrate true parallel execution capability
