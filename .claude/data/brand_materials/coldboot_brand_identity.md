### 1. Substack Profile

**Publication Name:** Coldboot
**URL:** coldboot.substack.com
**Tagline:** Hard reset for your AI assumptions

**About Section:**
```
Think of this as Ctrl+Alt+Delete for your AI strategy.

I'm a former engineering director who implemented AI at scale for a FAANG company. We burned through $8M before finding what actually works. Now I share those expensive lessons for free.

Coldboot delivers:
• Framework-based AI evaluation (no guessing)
• Real implementation data from Fortune 500 to startups
• Cost-benefit analysis that includes ALL costs
• Clear signals for when to pull the plug

Every system needs a cold reboot sometimes. Your AI strategy might need one too.

Published every Tuesday by someone who's been in the trenches.
```

**Welcome Message:**
```
Welcome to Coldboot.

You've just initiated a hard reset on AI hype.

What happens next:
1. Every Tuesday: One comprehensive AI reality analysis
2. Monthly: Framework updates based on new data
3. Quarterly: State of AI implementation report

Your first issue will analyze why 73% of AI projects fail in the first 6 months.

Coldboot: Where AI hype gets a hard reset.

After leading AI implementation at a FAANG company and watching $8M evaporate on failed projects, I learned what separates AI success from expensive failure.

Now I share frameworks and data to help you make better AI decisions:
• Proven evaluation frameworks from Fortune 500 implementations
• Real cost analysis (including the hidden 67% nobody mentions)
• Clear go/no-go decision trees
• Post-mortem analysis of spectacular failures

No vendor relationships. No affiliate links. Just engineering rigor applied to business decisions.

🔄 New analysis every Tuesday
📊 100+ implementations tracked
💡 Framework updates monthly

## System Philosophy

> "Every failed AI project is a successful learning opportunity.
> We just need better frameworks to capture those lessons."

The goal isn't to stop AI adoption. It's to make it systematic,
predictable, and engineering-driven rather than hype-driven.

When in doubt, coldboot.
