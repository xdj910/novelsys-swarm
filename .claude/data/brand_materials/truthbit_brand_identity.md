```
After watching $50M burn on failed AI projects across 15 companies, I started Truthbit to help tech leaders avoid the same mistakes.

Every week, I analyze:

‚Ä¢ Actual ROI from 150+ companies tracked
‚Ä¢ Hidden costs vendors won't tell you
‚Ä¢ When NOT to use AI (equally important)

No fluff. No hype. Just data.

Written by a 15-year tech veteran who learned the hard way.
