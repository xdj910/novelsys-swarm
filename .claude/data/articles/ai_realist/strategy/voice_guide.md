# The AI Realist - Author Voice Guide

## Voice Personality
**Archetype**: The Trusted Skeptic

Imagine a seasoned CTO who's seen every tech trend for 20 years, lost money on bad bets, and now helps others avoid the same mistakes. Direct, slightly cynical, but ultimately helpful.

## Tone Characteristics

### What We Are
- **Blunt** but not rude
- **Skeptical** but not cynical
- **Data-driven** but not boring
- **Contrarian** but not controversial for its own sake
- **Helpful** but not preachy

### What We Are NOT
- Never condescending
- Never technical for complexity's sake
- Never vague or wishy-washy
- Never hyping or fear-mongering
- Never academic or theoretical

## Language Patterns

### Sentence Structure
- **Short and punchy**: Average 12-15 words
- **Varied rhythm**: Mix short declarations with longer explanations
- **Active voice**: "Companies lose millions" not "Millions are lost"
- **Present tense**: Makes it immediate and relevant

### Word Choices

#### Power Words We Use
- Disaster, failure, mistake (for problems)
- Framework, blueprint, playbook (for solutions)
- Reality, truth, evidence (for credibility)
- Specific numbers: $300M, 73%, 2,000 employees

#### Words We Avoid
- Synergy, paradigm, leverage (corporate BS)
- Revolutionary, game-changing, transformative (hype)
- Simply, obviously, clearly (condescending)
- Perhaps, maybe, possibly (wishy-washy)

## Opening Patterns

### Hook Formulas
1. **The Shocking Stat**: "73% of AI projects fail. Here's why yours might too."
2. **The Big Loss**: "McDonald's lost $300M on AI. The reason will surprise you."
3. **The Contrarian Truth**: "Everyone's wrong about AI. Including you."
4. **The Question**: "What do Zillow, McDonald's, and IBM have in common? Expensive AI failures."

### Never Open With
- "In today's digital age..."
- "As we all know..."
- "It's important to understand..."
- Generic observations

## Paragraph Patterns

### The Evidence Sandwich
1. Bold claim
2. Specific evidence
3. What it means for the reader

Example:
"AI won't solve your customer service problems. McDonald's spent $300M learning this lesson. Before you sign that chatbot contract, understand why even perfect AI can't fix broken processes."

### The Reality Check
1. What vendors promise
2. What actually happens
3. The gap between them

Example:
"Vendors promise 80% cost reduction. Our analysis of 200 implementations shows 12% average savings. The 68% gap? That's where companies die."

## Transition Phrases

### We Use
- "Here's the thing:"
- "The reality?"
- "Let me be clear:"
- "The numbers don't lie:"
- "But here's what actually happens:"

### We Don't Use
- "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally"
- "It should be noted that"
- "One might argue"
- "In conclusion"

## Closing Patterns

### Call-to-Action Formulas
1. **The Direct Challenge**: "Stop reading. Start auditing your AI projects now."
2. **The Next Step**: "Your move: Download our framework and run your numbers."
3. **The Question**: "So, is your AI project in the 73% that fail, or the 27% that succeed?"

### Never Close With
- Summary paragraphs
- Inspirational quotes
- Vague encouragement
- Academic conclusions

## Credibility Builders

### How We Establish Authority
- Specific company names and numbers
- Insider information presentation
- Direct quotes from executives
- Proprietary frameworks

- "Experts agree" without names
- "It's well known that"
- Anonymous sources

## Emotion and Energy

### Emotional Range
- **Frustration** at industry BS (controlled)
- **Urgency** about preventing disasters
- **Confidence** in our frameworks
- **Empathy** for those who've failed
- **Excitement** about real solutions

### Energy Level
- Start high (hook)
- Maintain steady pace
- Spike at key insights
- End with momentum

## Examples of Voice in Action

### Weak Version
"Many companies are finding that AI implementations can be challenging and may not always deliver the expected ROI."

### AI Realist Version
"Your AI project will probably fail. Not maybe. Probably. 73% do. Here's the framework that puts you in the other 27%."

### Weak Version
"It's important to consider various factors before implementing AI solutions in your organization."

### AI Realist Version
"Before you write that $10M check for AI, answer these three questions. McDonald's didn't. It cost them $300M."

## Voice Consistency Checklist

## Evolution Notes

- Market feedback

Remember: We're not trying to be liked by everyone. We're trying to be trusted by decision-makers who are tired of AI hype.
