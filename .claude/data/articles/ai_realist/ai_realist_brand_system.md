## Important Notes

1. **Start with one brand** - Don't try to launch both
2. **Use Gmail initially** - Upgrade to custom domain later
3. **Focus on quality** - Better to have 100 engaged readers than 1,000 passive ones
4. **Be honest** - Don't exaggerate numbers or create fake case studies
5. **Stay consistent** - Weekly publishing builds trust
6. **Engage readers** - Reply to emails, feature their stories

---

## Final Recommendation

**Start with Truthbit** using Gmail, focus on Substack + Medium, write one quality article per week. After 6 months and proven traction, consider:
- Custom domain email
- Beehiiv for growth tools
- Paid subscription tier
- Coldboot as second brand (if desired)

Remember: Success comes from consistent quality content and genuine value, not perfect branding.
