# Round 2 Template Directory

This directory contains the template structure for iteration round 2.

## Structure

The round_2 directory follows the same structure as round_1:
- `drafts/` - Draft variations for round 2
- `research/` - Research and gap analysis
- `quality_reports/` - Quality assessments
- `optimization/` - Optimization results
- `gate_decisions/` - Quality gate decisions
- `status/` - Status tracking

## Usage

This template structure is replicated for each iteration round (up to 5 rounds maximum). Agents populate these directories during TTD-DR iteration processing.
