# Chapter 3: Room 237

The door to Room 237 stood before Sarah Mitchell like a portal to another world. The brass numbers seemed to shimmer in the dim hallway light.

"Please, Detective," Mr. Sterling pleaded one last time. "Some secrets are better left undiscovered."

But Sarah had come too far to turn back now. She inserted the master key and turned it slowly. The lock clicked open with an ominous finality.

## Scene 2: The Revelation

The room was empty. Not just unoccupied-completely, impossibly empty. No furniture, no carpet, no curtains. Just bare walls and a thick layer of dust that hadn't been disturbed in years.

"How is this possible?" Sarah whispered. "The food trays..."

Carmen gasped behind her. "The trays never actually went into this room. They went to Room 238."

Sarah turned sharply. "Then who's in Room 238?"

"That's just it," Carmen said, her voice barely audible. "According to our records, Room 238 doesn't exist."

## Scene 3: The Hidden Room

Behind what appeared to be a solid wall, Sarah discovered a narrow door, painted to perfectly match the wallpaper. Room 238-the room that shouldn't exist.

From inside came the sound of typing. Endless, mechanical typing that never seemed to pause.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Sarah called out. "This is Detective Mitchell. I need you to open this door."

The typing stopped. For a moment, there was absolute silence.

Then, a voice that sounded like it hadn't been used in months rasped: "You shouldn't have come here. Now you can never leave."
