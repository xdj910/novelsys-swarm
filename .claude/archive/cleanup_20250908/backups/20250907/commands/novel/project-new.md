# Create New Novel Project with Brainstorming

Creating project: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Book Number Convention
For all paths in this command:
- **BOOK_NUMBER** = 1 (new projects always start with book_1)
- When creating subsequent books, use /novel:next-book command
- Dynamic book support enables series expansion

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Series-Level Brainstorming
Gather series-level information first (this defines the overall project):

#### 1.1 Series Foundation
Ask: "What type of novel project is this?"
- **Project Format**:
  * Series: Multiple books sharing world/characters
  * Standalone: Single complete story
  * Trilogy: Three connected books
  * Collection: Short story anthology
  * Serial: Episodic web fiction

- **Language & Regional Variant**:
  * Primary Language: English/Other
  * English Variant: 
    - US English (largest market, Amazon default)
    - UK English (Commonwealth markets, certain settings)
    - International English (neutral, broad appeal)
    - Canadian English (US spelling, UK vocabulary)
    - Australian English (specific market)
  * Setting Influence:
    - If UK/European setting  ->  Consider UK English
    - If US/Canadian setting  ->  US English recommended  
    - If international/fantasy  ->  International English
  * Target Market Priority: US/UK/Global/Regional

- **Spelling & Vocabulary Preferences**:
  * Spelling System:
    - US spelling (-ize, -or, -er): maximize, color, center
    - UK spelling (-ise, -our, -re): maximise, colour, centre
    - Oxford spelling (-ize, -our, -re): maximize, colour, centre
  * Vocabulary Choice:
    - US terms (elevator, apartment, vacation, gas)
    - UK terms (lift, flat, holiday, petrol)
    - Neutral/both (avoid contentious terms)
  * Date Format: MM/DD/YYYY (US) or DD/MM/YYYY (UK/EU)
  * Measurement: Imperial/Metric/Both with conversion

- **Writing Style**:
  * Prose Approach: Contemporary/Literary/Commercial/Genre-specific
  * Complexity Level: Accessible/Moderate/Complex/Experimental
  * Cultural References: US pop culture/UK culture/International/Minimal

- **Language Selection Guide** (System Recommendations):
  ```
  IF setting = UK/Ireland/Europe AND target = UK/Europe:
     ->  UK English strongly recommended
  ELIF setting = US/Canada AND target = US:
     ->  US English strongly recommended
  ELIF genre = "Cozy Mystery" AND setting = UK village:
     ->  UK English (use "cosy" spelling)
  ELIF genre = "Cozy Mystery" AND setting = US small town:
     ->  US English (use "cozy" spelling)
  ELIF setting = Commonwealth (AU/NZ/SA):
     ->  UK English or local variant
  ELIF setting = International/Fantasy/Sci-Fi:
     ->  International English (US spelling, neutral vocabulary)
  ELSE (maximizing market reach):
     ->  US English (largest market) with neutral vocabulary
  
  Special Cases:
  - Canary Islands/Mediterranean  ->  UK English (British expat readers)

- Format:
```yaml
book_role:
  purpose_in_series: "Introduction/Foundation/Setup"
  establishes: ["world", "main characters", "central mystery"]
  
book_plot:
  main_conflict: "{specific to Book 1}"
  opening: "{how Book 1 starts}"
  climax: "{major turning point}"
  ending: "{resolution or cliffhanger}"
  
characters_in_book:
  introduced: ["character1", "character2"]
  focus: "primary character development"
  relationships_established: ["friendship1", "rivalry1"]
  
threads:
  opened: ["mystery1", "subplot1"]
  resolved: ["intro_conflict"]
  continuing: ["series_mystery"]
```

#### 3.5 Check Book 1 Brainstorming Completeness

**Validate Book 1 brainstorming:**
1. **Use Task tool with:**
   - subagent_type: "brainstorming-completeness-checker"
   - description: "Check book brainstorming completeness"
   - prompt: """
     Check completeness of book brainstorming
     - File: .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_1/book_brainstorming.yaml
     - Type: book
     - Minimum threshold: 80%

     """

2. **Handle incompleteness:**
   - If < 80%: Ask follow-up questions and update

### Phase 4: Project Structure Creation

**Ensure base system directories exist:**
- Use Bash tool: `mkdir -p .claude/data/context .claude/data/projects .claude/data/templates`

**Create unified series project structure (all projects are series):**

1. **Create base project directories:**
   - Use Bash tool: `mkdir -p .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_{BOOK_NUMBER}/{chapters,context}`
   - Use Bash tool: `mkdir -p .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/series_planning`
   - This creates the unified book_{BOOK_NUMBER} structure for all projects
   - Note: BOOK_NUMBER = 1 for new projects

2. **Create project-level directories:**
   - Use Bash tool: `mkdir -p .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/shared`
   - Use Bash tool: `mkdir -p .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/global_context`
   - These manage series-wide resources and context

### Phase 5: Book 1 Bible Generation (Iterative with Quality Gate)

**IMPORTANT: Book 1 Bible MUST inherit author_voice_signature from Series Bible**

#### 5.1 Generate Book 1 Bible V1

**Create directories for Bible versions:**
- Use Bash tool: `mkdir -p .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_{BOOK_NUMBER}/bible_versions`

**Launch bible-architect agent for Book 1 Bible:**

1. **Use Task tool with:**
   - subagent_type: "bible-architect"
   - description: "Generate Book 1 Bible V1"
   - prompt: "Create comprehensive Book 1 Bible for project '{PROJECT_NAME}'
     * MUST READ Series Bible first: .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/series_bible.yaml
     * Book brainstorming: .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_1/book_brainstorming.yaml
     * CRITICAL: Inherit author_voice_signature from Series Bible
     * Genre: {detected_genre} - already in series_bible
     * Include all 8 required sections
     * Character arcs must have chapter-by-chapter progression for Book 1
     * Voice profile MUST match Series Bible author_voice_signature
     * If mystery genre, include complete mystery_structure
     * Save to: .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_1/bible_versions/bible_v1.yaml"

2. **Confirm Bible V1 created:**
   - Use Read tool: `.claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_1/bible_versions/bible_v1.yaml`
   - If missing, report error and stop

#### 3.2 Bible Quality Review Loop

**Iteratively improve Bible until quality >= 95:**

**Iterative Bible quality improvement process (up to 5 iterations):**

Starting with version 1, repeat the following steps until quality score reaches 95 or maximum iterations (5) is reached:

**For each iteration:**

1. **Review current Bible version using Task tool:**
   - **subagent_type**: "bible-reviewer"
   - **description**: "Review Bible V[current_version]"
   - **prompt**: Provide the following instructions:
     ```
     Review Bible quality for project '**$PROJECT_NAME**'
     - Bible path: .claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/bible_versions/bible_v[current_version].yaml
     - Brainstorming path: .claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/brainstorming_results.yaml
     - Save review to: .claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/bible_reviews/review_v[current_version].json
     - Be thorough but constructive
     - Provide specific improvements
     ```

2. **Read review results:**
   - Use Read tool: `.claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/bible_reviews/review_v[current_version].json`
   - Extract the overall_score from the review

3. **Check quality threshold:**
   - Display: "Bible V[current_version] Score: [score]/100"
   - If score >= 95: 
     - Display: "[x] Bible V[current_version] meets quality standard: [score]/100"
     - Stop iteration and proceed to finalization
   - If score < 95 and not at max iterations:
     - Continue to improvement step

4. **Generate improved version (if needed):**
   - **Use Task tool:**
     - **subagent_type**: "bible-architect"
     - **description**: "Improve Bible to V[next_version]"
     - **prompt**: Provide the following instructions:
       ```
       Improve Bible based on review feedback
       - Previous Bible: .claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/bible_versions/bible_v[current_version].yaml
       - Review feedback: .claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/bible_reviews/review_v[current_version].json
       - Focus on critical issues first
       - Preserve strengths while fixing weaknesses
       - Save improved version to: .claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/bible_versions/bible_v[next_version].yaml
       ```
   - Increment version number and repeat from step 1

5. **Handle max iterations:**
   - If 5 iterations completed without reaching 95:
     - Display: "WARNING:Ô∏è Warning: Max iterations reached. Final score: [score]/100"
     - Display: "Consider manual intervention or adjusting requirements."

#### 5.3 Finalize Book 1 Bible

**Copy best version as the official Bible:**
- Use Bash tool: `cp .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_1/bible_versions/bible_v{current_version}.yaml .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_1/bible.yaml`
- Display: "[x] Book 1 Bible finalized with quality score: {quality_score}/100"
- Display: "[x] Voice profile successfully inherited from Series Bible"

### Phase 6: Generate Book Outline (Iterative with Quality Gate)

#### 4.1 Create directories for outline versions

**Setup outline versioning structure:**
- Use Bash tool: `mkdir -p .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_1/outline_versions`
- Use Bash tool: `mkdir -p .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_1/outline_reviews`

#### 4.2 Generate Outline V1

**Create initial book outline from Bible:**

1. **Display progress:**

2. **Launch book-outline-architect agent:**
   - Use Task tool with:
     * subagent_type: "book-outline-architect"
     * description: "Generate outline V1"
     * prompt: """
       Create comprehensive book outline for project '{PROJECT_NAME}'
       - Bible path: .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_1/bible.yaml

3. **Verify outline V1 created:**
   - Use Read tool: `.claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_1/outline_versions/outline_v1.yaml`
   - If missing, report error and stop
   - Display: "[x] Outline V1 generated"

#### 4.3 Outline Quality Review Loop

**Iteratively improve outline until quality >= 95:**

**Iterative Outline quality improvement process (up to 4 iterations):**

Starting with version 1, repeat the following steps until quality score reaches 95 or maximum iterations (4) is reached:

**For each iteration:**

1. **Review current Outline version using Task tool:**
   - **subagent_type**: "book-outline-reviewer"
   - **description**: "Review Outline V[current_version]"
   - **prompt**: Provide the following instructions:
     ```
     Review book outline quality for project '**$PROJECT_NAME**'
     - Outline path: .claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/outline_versions/outline_v[current_version].yaml
     - Bible path: .claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/bible.yaml
     - Save review to: .claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/outline_reviews/review_v[current_version].json
     - Be thorough but constructive
     - Focus on story structure, pacing, and completeness
     ```

2. **Read review results:**
   - Use Read tool: `.claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/outline_reviews/review_v[current_version].json`
   - Extract the overall_score from the review

3. **Check quality threshold:**
   - Display: "Outline V[current_version] Score: [score]/100"
   - If score >= 95:
     - Display: "[x] Outline V[current_version] meets quality standard: [score]/100"
     - Stop iteration and proceed to finalization
   - If score < 95 and not at max iterations:
     - Continue to improvement step

4. **Generate improved version (if needed):**
   - **Use Task tool:**
     - **subagent_type**: "book-outline-architect"
     - **description**: "Improve Outline to V[next_version]"
     - **prompt**: Provide the following instructions:
       ```
       Improve book outline based on review feedback
       - Previous Outline: .claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/outline_versions/outline_v[current_version].yaml
       - Review feedback: .claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/outline_reviews/review_v[current_version].json
       - Bible: .claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/bible.yaml
       - Focus on critical issues first, then high priority items
       - Preserve strengths while fixing weaknesses
       - Save improved version to: .claude/data/projects/**$PROJECT_NAME**/book_1/outline_versions/outline_v[next_version].yaml
       ```
   - Increment version number and repeat from step 1

5. **Handle max iterations:**
   - If 4 iterations completed without reaching 95:
     - Display: "WARNING:Ô∏è Warning: Max iterations reached. Final score: [score]/100"
     - Display: "Consider manual intervention or adjusting requirements."

#### 4.4 Finalize Outline

**Copy best version as the official outline:**
- Use Bash tool: `cp .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_1/outline_versions/outline_v{current_version}.yaml .claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/book_1/outline.yaml`
- Display: "[x] Book Outline finalized with quality score: {quality_score}/100"
- Display key metrics: "{total_chapters} chapters, {act_count} acts, {tension_peaks} tension peaks"

### Phase 7: Initialize Project Metadata

**Create and save project metadata:**

1. **Build project metadata object with:**
   - name: PROJECT_NAME
   - type: PROJECT_TYPE (from brainstorming)
   - genre: GENRE (from brainstorming)
   - status: "planning"
   - bible_created: true
   - series_bible_created: true   # Created during project initialization
   - books_planned: 1             # Start with single book (can extend later)
   - created: current_timestamp
   - brainstorm_results: (all brainstorming answers)
   - progress:
     * total_chapters: PLANNED_CHAPTERS
     * completed_chapters: 0
     * current_chapter: 0
     * total_words: 0

2. **Save metadata:**
   - Use Write tool: `.claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/project.json`

   - project: PROJECT_NAME
   - type: PROJECT_TYPE
   - switched_at: current_timestamp

2. **Save as current project:**
   - Use Write tool: `.claude/data/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/current_project.json`
   - Write current project object as JSON
   
3. **Also update global current project (if needed):**
   - Check if `.claude/data/context/` directory exists
   - If yes, use Write tool: `.claude/data/context/current_project.json`
   - Write current project reference as JSON

### Phase 9: Generate Planning Documents

Create initial planning documents based on project type:

#### For Series
- Series roadmap
- Book breakdown
- Character evolution arcs

## Error Handling

- If project name already exists: Prompt for different name or confirm overwrite
- If brainstorming interrupted: Save partial results and allow resume
- If Bible generation fails: Retry with manual input option


## Notes

- This command now includes the full brainstorming and Bible creation process
- The separate `/novel:bible-create` command becomes optional (for re-creating or updating Bible)
- All project decisions are made upfront during creation
- Project type determines the file structure and workflow
