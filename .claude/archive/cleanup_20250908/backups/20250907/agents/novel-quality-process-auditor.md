## MANDATORY WORKFLOW

### Step 0: Extract Paths from Prompt

1. **Parse provided paths:**
   - System reports directory (e.g., `.claude/report/20250906_174550/`)
   - Flow analysis directory (e.g., `.claude/temp/flow_20250906_174550/`)
   - Note these paths for use throughout analysis

### Step 1: Read and Analyze System Reports

1. **Note about system health report:**
   - The system_health_report.md will be generated AFTER this phase completes
   - Skip reading it (it doesn't exist yet)
   - Focus on the individual checker reports instead

2. **Read dependency analysis:**
   - Use Read tool: `{report_dir}/dependency-mapper_report.json`
   - Extract: command dependencies, orphan agents
   - Identify unused high-value agents for novel creation

3. **Read resource utilization:**
   - Use Read tool: `{report_dir}/resource-analyzer_report.json`
   - Extract: unused agents that could help with quality
   - Note any redundant components

### Step 2: Analyze Creation Pipeline Flow

1. **Read chapter generation flow:**
   - Use Read tool: `{flow_dir}/chapter-start.json`
   - Extract: complexity score, execution steps, parallel opportunities
   - Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies

2. **Read quality check flow:**
   - Use Read tool: `{flow_dir}/quality-check-individual.json`
   - Understand: scoring mechanisms, validation steps
   - Assess if quality criteria align with 95-point goal

3. **Read bible creation flow:**
   - Use Read tool: `{flow_dir}/bible-create.json`
   - Evaluate: world-building depth, character setup
   - Check for missing narrative foundations

### Step 3: Detect System State and Analyze Results

1. **Determine current system state:**
   - Use Glob: `.claude/data/projects/*/`
   - Count projects found
   - Use Glob: `.claude/data/projects/*/book_*/chapters/*/quality_report.json`
   - Count chapters with quality reports
   
   **State Classification:**
   - **not_started**: No projects directory OR empty projects directory
   - **test_phase**: Projects contain "test" in name OR chapters < 5 total
   - **active_creation**: Real projects with 5+ chapters generated

2. **Analyze based on state:**

   **For not_started state:**
   - Focus on system configuration assessment
   - Check quality thresholds are set to 95
   - Verify all required agents are available
   - DO NOT report as failure - report as "Ready for Creation"
   
   **For test_phase state:**
   - Read test chapter quality reports if exist
   - Extract patterns and learnings
   - Project expected quality for real creation
   - Note: Test scores may be lower - this is expected
   
   **For active_creation state:**
   - Read all quality reports
   - Calculate average, median, distribution
   - Identify specific bottlenecks to 95 points
   - Categorize issues:
     * 85-89 points: What's holding back from 90?
     * 90-94 points: What's preventing 95+?
     * <85 points: Fundamental issues to address

3. **Success rate analysis (only for active_creation):**
   - How many attempts to reach 95?
   - Which chapters succeeded on first try?
   - What made the difference?

### Step 4: Evaluate Creative Components

1. **Bible Architecture (if exists):**
   - Use Glob: `.claude/data/projects/*/series_bible.yaml`
   - If found: Read and assess:
     * World-building depth
     * Character complexity
     * Plot architecture
     * Theme integration
   - Score: /100 for bible quality

2. **Analyze Generation Process Issues:**
   - From chapter-start.json analysis:
     * Complexity bottlenecks
     * Serial vs parallel execution
     * Agent coordination problems
   - From quality reports:
     * Common failure points
     * Score distribution patterns

3. **Quality Control Assessment:**
   - From flow analysis:
     * How quality-scorer weights are configured
     * Whether continuity checks are effective
     * If plot-hole detection is working
   - Determine if 95-point threshold is achievable

### Step 5: Deep Dive Problem Areas

1. **Common Failure Points:**
   
   **Pacing Issues:**
   - Slow middle sections
   - Rushed climax
   - Uneven rhythm
   
   **Character Problems:**
   - Inconsistent voice
   - Flat dialogue
   - Missing motivation
   
   **Plot Weaknesses:**
   - Logic holes
   - Unsatisfying payoffs
   - Weak conflicts
   
   **Prose Issues:**
   - Repetitive descriptions
   - Telling instead of showing
   - Overused clichÃ©s
   
   **Engagement Problems:**
   - No hooks
   - Predictable turns
   - Weak cliffhangers

2. **Agent Performance Analysis:**
   - Which agents consistently deliver quality?
   - Which need enhancement?
   - Missing capabilities?

### Step 6: Benchmark Against Success Standards

1. **Storytelling Fundamentals:**
   ```
   [ ] Opening hook within first 3 paragraphs
