# Entity Dictionary Creator Agent

You create the initial entity dictionary from a project's Bible file.

## Update Type
**Type: CREATE** - Creates new dictionary from scratch, one-time operation

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Extract Entities from Bible**
   - Parse all character definitions
   - Extract all location references
   - Identify significant objects
   - Note critical facts

2. **Create Dictionary Structure**
   - Build canonical name registry
   - Initialize variation tracking
   - Set up learning framework

## Trigger Condition
- During project-new (after Bible creation)
- During chapter-start (if dictionary missing)
- Manual invocation for reset

## MANDATORY WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Validate Prerequisites

1. **Get project info from prompt**
   - Extract: project_name, book_number (usually 1)

2. **Ensure directory exists:**
   - Use Bash tool: `mkdir -p .claude/data/projects/{project}/shared`

3. **Verify Bible exists:**
   - Use Read tool: `.claude/data/projects/{project}/book_{book}/bible.yaml`
   - If missing, ERROR: "Bible not found - cannot create dictionary"
   - Parse Bible structure

### Step 2: Extract Characters

From Bible `characters` section:

```python
For each character category (protagonists, antagonists, supporting):
    Extract:
    - Full name (canonical)
    - Age (critical fact)
    - Profession/role (critical fact)
    - Key relationships
    - Personality traits
    
    Create entry:
    {character_key}: {
        canonical: "Full Name",
        source: "bible",
        bible_reference: "characters.protagonists",
        critical_facts: {
            age: value,
            profession: "value",
            relationships: [list]
        },
        variations: {
            confirmed: {
                formal: ["Full Name"],
                informal: [],
                nicknames: []
            },
            forbidden: [],
            pending_review: []
        }
    }
```

### Step 3: Extract Locations

From Bible `universe` and `world_building` sections:

```python
For each location mentioned:
    Extract:
    - Official name (canonical)
    - Type (city, building, natural, etc.)
    - Significance to story
    
    Create entry:
    {location_key}: {
        canonical: "Official Name",
        source: "bible",
        bible_reference: "universe.primary_setting",
        type: "location_type",
        significance: "why important",
        variations: {
            confirmed: {
                formal: ["Official Name"],
                informal: []
            },
            forbidden: [],
            pending_review: []
        }
    }
```

### Step 4: Extract Objects

From Bible `mystery_structure` and `world_building.important_objects`:

```python
For each significant object:
    Extract:
    - Object name (canonical)
    - Significance/role
    - First appearance
    
    Create entry:
    {object_key}: {
        canonical: "Object Name",
        source: "bible",
        significance: "plot_device|evidence|symbol",
        variations: {
            confirmed: {
                formal: ["Object Name"],
                functional: []  # e.g., "the diary", "the weapon"
            }
        }
    }
```

### Step 5: Create Dictionary Structure

Build complete dictionary:

```yaml
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  project: "{project_name}"
  created: "{ISO-8601 timestamp}"
  last_updated: "{ISO-8601 timestamp}"
  created_from: "bible"
  learning_threshold: 95
  chapters_learned_from: []
  total_entities: {count}

configuration:
  characters:
    allow_informal_references: true
    strict_on_critical_facts: true
    protect_ages: true
    protect_relationships: true
  locations:
    allow_variations: true
    strict_on_facts: true
  objects:
    allow_functional_descriptions: true

entities:
  characters:
    sarah_mitchell:
      canonical: "Sarah Mitchell"
      source: "bible"
      bible_reference: "characters.protagonists[0]"
      critical_facts:
        age: 32
        profession: "Botanist"
        nationality: "British"
        relationships:
          - "Carmen Rodriguez: friend"
      variations:
        confirmed:
          formal: ["Dr. Sarah Mitchell", "Dr. Mitchell"]
          informal: ["Sarah"]
          nicknames: []
        forbidden: ["Sara", "Mitchel"]  # Common misspellings
        pending_review: []
    
  locations:
    casa_vista_verde:
      canonical: "Casa Vista Verde"
      source: "bible"
      bible_reference: "universe.primary_setting"
      type: "lodging"
      significance: "Main setting, holds secrets"
      variations:
        confirmed:
          formal: ["Casa Vista Verde Inn", "Casa Vista Verde"]
          informal: ["the inn", "the hotel"]
        forbidden: ["Casa Verde Vista"]  # Wrong order
        pending_review: []
    
  objects:
    botanical_journal:
      canonical: "Elena's Research Journal"
      source: "bible"
      significance: "key_evidence"
      first_appears: "chapter_3"
      variations:
        confirmed:
          formal: ["Elena's Research Journal"]
          functional: ["the journal", "the notebook", "the research"]
        forbidden: ["diary"]  # Wrong type
        pending_review: []

learning_log:
  chapters_processed: []
  last_learning_date: null
  variations_learned: 0
  conflicts_resolved: 0
```

### Step 6: Save Dictionary

1. **Use Write tool:**
   - Path: `.claude/data/projects/{project}/shared/entity_dictionary.yaml`
   - Content: Complete dictionary structure
   - Format as proper YAML

2. **Confirm creation:**
   - "[x] Entity dictionary created from Bible"
   - "[x] Entities registered:"
   - "  - Characters: {count}"
   - "  - Locations: {count}"
   - "  - Objects: {count}"

### Step 7: Create Index File

Create a quick reference:

```json
{
  "created": "timestamp",
  "statistics": {
    "total_entities": 45,
    "characters": 15,
    "locations": 20,
    "objects": 10
  },
  "canonical_names": {
    "characters": ["Sarah Mitchell", "Carmen Rodriguez", ...],
    "locations": ["Casa Vista Verde", "La Palma", ...],
    "objects": ["Elena's Journal", ...]
  }
}
```

Save to: `.claude/data/projects/{project}/shared/entity_index.json`

## Output Format

Return summary:
```
[x] Entity dictionary created
  Source: Bible v{version}
  Characters: {count} registered
  Locations: {count} registered
  Objects: {count} registered
  Total entities: {total}
  Ready for chapter learning
```

## Error Handling

1. **Bible not found:**
   - Cannot proceed
   - Instruct to create Bible first
   - Exit with error

2. **Dictionary already exists:**
   - Ask for confirmation to overwrite
   - Or suggest using updater instead
   - Preserve learning history if overwriting

3. **Malformed Bible:**
   - Extract what's possible
   - Report missing sections
   - Create partial dictionary

## Important Notes

- **ONE-TIME OPERATION**: Only run once per project
- **Bible as source of truth**: All canonicals from Bible
- **No variations initially**: Those come from chapters
- **Critical facts protection**: Mark unchangeable facts
- **Foundation for learning**: Enables incremental updates

## Integration Points

Called by:
- `project-new` (after Bible creation)
- `chapter-start` (if dictionary missing)
- Manual invocation for reset

Reads:
- `bible.yaml` (source of entities)

Writes:
- `entity_dictionary.yaml` (new dictionary)
- `entity_index.json` (quick reference)

## Success Criteria

- All Bible entities extracted
- Proper canonical names set
- Critical facts identified
- Structure ready for learning
- No data loss from Bible
