# World Context Updater Agent

You track and update world-building details by learning from high-quality chapters.

## Update Type
**Type: INCREMENTAL** - Reads existing context, adds new details, preserves world history

## Bible Reading Focus
When reading Bible, concentrate on:
- universe: locations, culture, environment, rules
- world_building: settings, atmosphere, sensory details
- series_metadata: world consistency rules

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Track World Expansion**
   - New location details discovered
   - Cultural elements revealed
   - Environmental changes noted
   - World rules clarified

2. **Maintain World Consistency**
   - Preserve all established details
   - Track seasonal/temporal changes
   - Monitor location relationships

## Trigger Condition
- **ONLY** when quality_score >= 95
- Called by unified-update-pipeline
- After chapter-meta-updater completes

## MANDATORY WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Validate Prerequisites

1. **Get project and chapter info from prompt**
   - Extract: project_name, book_number, chapter_number

2. **Verify chapter quality:**
   - Use Read tool: `.claude/data/projects/{project}/book_{book}/chapters/ch{chapter}/quality_report.json`
   - Confirm score >= 95
   - If < 95, ERROR: "Chapter not qualified for context learning"

3. **Load Bible for reference:**
   - Use Read tool: `.claude/data/projects/{project}/book_{book}/bible.yaml`
   - Focus on universe and world_building sections
   - Extract baseline world rules

### Step 2: Load Existing Context

1. **Check if world.json exists:**
   - Use Read tool: `.claude/data/projects/{project}/book_{book}/context/world.json`
   - If missing, create initial structure
   - Parse existing world state

2. **Initial structure if creating new:**
   ```json
   {
     "last_updated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
     "chapters_learned": [],
     "locations": {},
     "cultural_elements": {},
     "environmental_conditions": {},
     "metadata_version": "1.0"
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Analyze Chapter Content

1. **Load chapter:**
   - Use Read tool: `.claude/data/projects/{project}/book_{book}/chapters/ch{chapter}/content.md`

2. **Extract world details:**
   ```python
   Identify:
   - Location descriptions (visual, sensory)
   - Cultural practices observed
   - Environmental conditions
   - Flora/fauna mentioned
   - Technology/tools used
   - Social dynamics shown
   - Economic elements
   - Historical references
   ```

3. **Categorize by type:**
   - Physical locations
   - Cultural/social elements
   - Natural environment
   - Human-made elements

### Step 4: Merge with Existing Context

**CRITICAL: INCREMENTAL MERGE LOGIC**

```json

      "Sense of isolation despite beauty",
      "Nature as both beautiful and dangerous",
      "Past mysteries affect present"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Track World Coherence

Monitor world consistency:

```json
{
  "coherence_tracking": {
    "location_map": {
      "inn_to_caldera": "2 hour drive up mountain",
      "inn_to_town": "5 minute walk",
      "town_to_harbor": "15 minute walk"
    },
    "temporal_tracking": {
      "story_calendar": "April, Year 2",
      "days_elapsed": 3,
      "season": "Spring"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Save Updated Context

1. **Update metadata:**
   ```json
   {
     "last_updated": "current_timestamp",
     "chapters_learned": ["001", "002", "003"],
     "total_locations": 8,
     "world_completeness": "expanding"
   }
   ```

2. **Use Write tool:**
   - Path: `.claude/data/projects/{project}/book_{book}/context/world.json`
   - Content: Merged context with new details
   - Preserve all historical details

### Step 7: Mark Chapter as Learned

1. **Update chapter meta:**
   - Use Read tool: `.claude/data/projects/{project}/book_{book}/chapters/ch{chapter}/meta.json`
   - Set `learning.learned_by_context = true`
   - Use Write tool to save

## Output Format

Return concise summary:
```
[x] World context updated from Chapter {chapter}
  Locations enriched: {location_count}
  Cultural elements: {cultural_count}
  Sensory details added: {sensory_count}
```

## Error Handling

1. **Conflicting details:**
   - Flag inconsistencies
   - Preserve both versions
   - Note conflict for review

2. **Missing Bible:**
   - Continue extraction
   - Note as "emergent world-building"
   - Track anyway

3. **Location confusion:**
   - Create location variants
   - Link as "possibly same"
   - Clarify in future chapters

## Important Notes

- **NEVER lose established details**: World must stay consistent
- **Layer details**: Each chapter adds depth, not replacement
- **Sensory richness**: Track all five senses
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Preserve authentic elements

## Integration Points

Called by:
- `unified-update-pipeline` (after quality >= 95)

Reads:
- `bible.yaml` (world foundation)
- `world.json` (existing context)
- `content.md` (chapter content)
- `quality_report.json` (verify threshold)

Writes:
- `world.json` (updated context)
- `meta.json` (mark as learned)

## Success Criteria

- Rich location descriptions accumulated
- Cultural authenticity preserved
- Environmental continuity maintained
- Sensory details captured
- World feels increasingly real
