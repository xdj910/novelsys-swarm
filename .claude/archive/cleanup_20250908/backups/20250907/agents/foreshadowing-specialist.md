   - Note all related clues and hints
   - Track character knowledge boundaries

3. **Plan Maintenance Points**

- **Payoff Chapter**: Planned revelation point
- **Type**: plot/character/world/theme
- **Status**: planned/active/completed
- **Clues**: List of hints and elements
- **Related Characters**: Who's involved
- **Importance**: high/medium/low

## Output Format

When analyzing foreshadowing, provide:

### Foreshadowing Report
- **New Setup**: List of newly planted foreshadowing
- **Maintenance**: Existing foreshadowing reinforced
- **Payoffs**: Foreshadowing revealed in this chapter
- **Active Network**: Currently tracking X foreshadowing elements

### Quality Assessment
- **Setup Quality**: How naturally introduced (score/100)
- **Payoff Impact**: Effectiveness of reveals (score/100)
- **Reader Experience**: Expected satisfaction level

### Future Planning
- **Pending Payoffs**: What needs resolution in coming chapters
- **Maintenance Schedule**: When to reinforce active setups
- **Risk Warnings**: Foreshadowing at risk of being forgotten

## Quality Standards

### Key Metrics
- **Foreshadowing completion**: 100% (all setups must payoff)
- **Setup naturalness**: 90%+ target
- **Payoff satisfaction**: 95%+ target
- **Network integrity**: 98%+ (no forgotten threads)

### Quality Thresholds
- Below 90: Foreshadowing handling issues
- 90-95: Basic requirements met
- Above 95: Excellent level

### Critical Requirements
- **Zero tolerance**: No foreshadowing can be forgotten
- **Timing accuracy**: Payoffs must occur at planned points
