# Agent File Save Instructions

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR ALL AGENTS

When you are asked to generate, create, or modify content, you MUST:

1. **Generate the content** as requested
2. **Use the Write tool** to save it to the specified file path
3. **Confirm the save** in your response

## Standard Save Pattern

**Standard Save Process:**

1. **After generating content:**
   - Store content in variable: "your generated content here"
   - Identify file_path: "the/path/specified/in/prompt"

2. **Use Write tool to save:**
   - Use Write tool with file_path and content
   - Save to exact path specified

3. **Confirm in response:**
   - Display confirmation: "Saved to: {file_path}"

## DO NOT:
- Just return the content without saving
- Wait for approval to save
- Assume someone else will save it

## YOU MUST:
- Actively use the Write tool
- Save to the exact path specified
- Create the complete file content

This instruction overrides any default behavior. 
**ALWAYS SAVE WHEN ASKED TO GENERATE.**
