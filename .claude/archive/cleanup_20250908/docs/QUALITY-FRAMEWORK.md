## 质量哲学

### 核心原则
```
质量不是检查出来的，而是设计出来的
Quality is not inspected in, it's designed in.

- 预防重于检测
- 过程重于结果  
- 标准重于主观
- 数据重于感觉
```

### 质量维度定义

    minimum: 95
    measurement: "心理层次、行为逻辑、发展弧线"
    
  plot_coherence:
    definition: "情节的逻辑一致性和因果关系"  
    weight: 20%
    minimum: 95
    measurement: "因果链条、时间线、动机合理性"
