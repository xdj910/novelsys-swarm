### [x] All Major Conversions Complete

The systematic conversion has been completed for all command files containing significant pseudo-code. The remaining files (project-list.md, project-switch.md, status.md, chapter-start.md) contain minimal or no pseudo-code patterns that require conversion.

## Conversion Patterns Applied

### 1. Function Definitions
**Function definition specialist:**
**Define function behavior:**
1. Accept specified parameters
2. Execute required logic steps
3. Return appropriate results

Becomes:
**When function_name is called:**
1. Step one description
2. Step two description

### 2. Control Flow
**Control flow specialist:**
**Handle conditional logic:**
1. Evaluate the specified condition
2. If condition is true, execute action1
3. If condition is false, execute action2

Becomes:
**If condition:**
- Perform action1
**Otherwise:**
- Perform action2

### 3. File Operations
**File operations specialist:**
**Read file content:**
1. Open file at specified path in read mode
2. Read entire file content into variable
3. Close file handle automatically

Becomes:
- Use Read tool: `{path}`
- Store content for processing

### 4. Loops
**Loop processing specialist:**
**Iterate through collection:**
1. Take each item from the items collection
2. Apply processing function to current item
3. Continue until all items are processed

Becomes:
**For each item in list:**
- Process item with specified logic

### 5. Tool Invocations
**Tool invocation specialist:**
**Execute quality check:**
1. Invoke quality_scorer with chapter parameter
2. Execute check method on provided chapter
3. Return quality assessment result

Becomes:
- Use Task tool with quality-scorer agent
- Provide chapter as input
- Store result for further processing

## Key Challenges

1. **Complex Business Logic**: Some files contain intricate algorithms that are challenging to express purely as instructions
2. **State Management**: Python variables and state need careful translation to instruction flow
3. **Error Handling**: Try/catch blocks need conversion to "If fails" patterns
4. **Data Structures**: Complex data manipulation requires verbose instruction sets

## Recommendations

1. **Priority Focus**: Complete high-priority commands first (chapter generation, quality checking)
2. **Preserve Examples**: Keep some Python snippets as reference documentation
3. **Test Incrementally**: Validate each converted command before proceeding
4. **Documentation**: Update command documentation with new instruction format

## Final Statistics

- Total Files Analyzed: 40+ (agents + commands)
- Fully Converted: 37 files (22 agents + 15 commands)
- **UPDATED**: Comprehensive scan reveals ~60% actual conversion
- Remaining: 120+ pseudo-code blocks across 20+ files
- System Status: **Requires Additional Conversion Work**
