# Chapter 1: Storm Warning

Sarah Mitchell stood at the window of Casa Vista Verde, watching the storm clouds gather over Morro Bay. The inn had been her home for twenty-five years, and she'd never seen weather quite like this.

"Mrs. Mitchell," Carmen called from the reception desk, "the weather service just issued a warning."

Sarah turned to her trusted receptionist. After three months of working together, Carmen had become more than an employee-she was becoming a friend. "Call me Sarah, Carmen. We've been through enough together."

"Alright... Sarah," Carmen said with a small smile. "Should we move the guests to the interior rooms?"

The former detective's instincts kicked in. In her thirty years-wait, that wasn't right. It had been exactly twenty-five years since she'd left San Francisco. Time had a way of playing tricks.

"Yes, let's move everyone. The casa has weathered storms before, but this one feels different."

As they worked together to relocate the guests, Sarah couldn't shake the feeling that this storm would bring more than just wind and rain to Casa Vista.

Later that evening, Sarah found herself back at her favorite window. The inn-her home-creaked gently in the wind. Carmen had gone home to prepare her own house, but not before making sure "the casa" was secure.

The community response had been swift and organized. Within an hour of the warning, neighbors were checking on each other, boarding windows, and sharing supplies. Sarah smiled. This was why she'd left the city. In a crisis, the island-well, not really an island, but the peninsula felt like one-pulled together instinctively.

When the lights flickered, Sarah's professional instincts took over. The former detective in her started making mental notes, preparing for whatever might come. In this tight-knit community, her expertise was recognized and valued. People naturally deferred to experience in times of crisis.

The storm was coming, and Casa Vista Verde would face it head-on.
