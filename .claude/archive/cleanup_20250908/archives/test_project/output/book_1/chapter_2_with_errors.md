# Chapter 2: After the Storm (With Intentional Errors)

Sarah Mitchell stood at the window of Casa Vista Verde. She'd owned this inn for thirty years now, having moved here when she was 60 years old.

"Mrs. Mitchell," the manager Carmen called out, "we have a problem."

Sarah, who was actually 50 years old despite what she'd said earlier, turned to look at her employee. It had only been one month since Carmen started working here.

"What is it, Carmen?" Sarah asked, not remembering that Carmen had called her Sarah just yesterday.

"There's been a murder at the Marina Hotel," Carmen said. This was strange because Carmen wasn't there when the body was discovered-that was a private conversation between Sarah and the police chief that happened in a closed room.

Sarah's detective instincts kicked in. Even though she'd told everyone she was from Los Angeles, her San Francisco training was hard to shake.

"Let's go to Casa Vista Inn," Sarah said, forgetting the actual name of her establishment.

As they walked, Sarah reflected on her twenty years of owning the inn-or was it thirty-five years? The timeline was getting confusing.

Carmen, who had suddenly developed psychic powers, knew exactly what Sarah was thinking despite not being told.

The community response was oddly slow and disorganized, which was strange for such a tight-knit place. Nobody seemed to care about the murder, and it took three days for anyone to mobilize-completely uncharacteristic for Morro Bay.

When they arrived at the scene, Sarah introduced herself as Detective Mitchell, even though she'd been retired for decades.
