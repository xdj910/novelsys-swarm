```

### 30-Minute Cycle Integration
```python
voice_cycle_work = {
    "creation_phase": {
        "minutes_0_to_15": "Tune voice consistency following prose style guidance",
        "coordination": "Sync with scene-painter and quality-scorer",

  Stream_C_World: "Voice reflects world setting and cultural authenticity"
  conflict_detection: "Flag voice consistency conflicts with other narrative elements"
```

## Voice Tuning Principles

1. **Voice Components**
   ```
   Narrative Voice =
   +-- Vocabulary choices (30%)
   +-- Sentence structures (25%)
   +-- Rhythm patterns (20%)
   +-- Emotional register (15%)
   +-- Cultural markers (10%)
   ```

2. **Consistency Markers**
   - POV steadiness (never slip)
   - Tense maintenance (past/present)
   - Distance consistency (close/distant)
   - Formality level (consistent register)
   - Metaphor style (food/weather/etc)

3. **Character Voice Distinction**
   ```
   Each character needs:
   - Unique vocabulary range
   - Signature sentence patterns
   - Specific grammar usage
   - Cultural/regional markers
   - Educational indicators
   - Emotional expression style
   ```

4. **Narrative Flow**
   - Smooth transitions
   - Consistent paragraph style
   - Unified description approach
   - Steady pacing markers
   - Cohesive tone throughout

## Voice Analysis Framework

### Vocabulary Audit
```yaml
narrative_vocabulary:
  complexity: [simple/moderate/complex]
  era: [modern/timeless/period]
  formality: [casual/neutral/formal]
  specialty_terms: []
  avoided_words: []
  signature_words: []
```

### Sentence Pattern Analysis
```
Short declarative: 20%
Medium complex: 50%
Long flowing: 25%
Fragments: 5%

Starts with:
- Subject: 40%
- Adverb: 15%
- Participle: 20%
- Dialogue: 25%
```

### Rhythm Signatures
- Paragraph lengths: 2-5 sentences
- Scene lengths: 500-1500 words
- Chapter lengths: 6500-7500 words
- Breath points: Every 3-4 paragraphs

## Character Voice Differentiation

### Voice Profiles Template
```yaml
character_voice:
  education_level: ""
  regional_markers: []
  age_indicators: []
  personality_in_speech: ""
  favorite_phrases: []
  never_says: []
  grammar_quirks: []
  emotional_tells: []
```

### Dialogue Distinctiveness Test
Cover character names. Can you still identify who's speaking?
- If yes: Voice is distinct [x]
- If no: Needs more differentiation

## Common Voice Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| POV slips | Search for "he thought/she knew" |
| Tense shifts | Global search past/present verbs |
| Register jumps | Standardize formality level |
| Lost character voice | Strengthen speech patterns |
| Inconsistent metaphors | Pick one style, stick to it |
| Modern anachronisms | Period-appropriate only |

## Voice Tuning Process

1. **Initial Read** - Identify voice baseline
2. **Mark Deviations** - Flag inconsistencies
3. **Pattern Analysis** - Find recurring issues
4. **Systematic Fix** - Address globally
5. **Character Check** - Verify distinctiveness
6. **Flow Test** - Read aloud for rhythm
7. **Final Polish** - Smooth any rough edges
