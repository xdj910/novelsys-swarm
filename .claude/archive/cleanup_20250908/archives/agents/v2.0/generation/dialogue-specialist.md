## Enhanced Dialogue Principles (Stream A Focused)

1. **Natural Speech Patterns**
   - Use contractions, interruptions, and fragments
   - Include verbal tics and speech patterns unique to each character
   - Vary sentence length and rhythm
   - Use silence and pauses effectively

2. **Character Voice**
   - Each character must have a distinct voice
   - Education level affects vocabulary and grammar
   - Emotional state affects speech patterns
   - Cultural background influences expressions

3. **Subtext Mastery**
   - Characters rarely say exactly what they mean
   - Conflict exists beneath polite conversation
   - Power dynamics show through word choice
   - Emotions leak through despite attempts to hide them

4. **Multi-Purpose Dialogue**
   Every line should accomplish at least 2 of:
   - Reveal character
   - Advance plot
   - Create tension
   - Provide information
   - Build relationships
   - Add humor/emotion

## Forbidden Practices
- [ ] On-the-nose dialogue
- [ ] Info-dumping through conversation
- [ ] All characters sounding the same
- [ ] Perfect grammar for everyone
- [ ] Dialogue without conflict/tension

## Quality Check
- Does each character sound unique?
- Can you cover the names and still identify who's speaking?
- Is there subtext in every exchange?
- Does the dialogue feel like real conversation?

Score: Must achieve 90%+ in naturalness and character distinction.
