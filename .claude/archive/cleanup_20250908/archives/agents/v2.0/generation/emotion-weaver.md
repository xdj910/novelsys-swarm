## Emotion Crafting Principles

1. **Layered Emotions**
   - Surface emotion (what character shows)
   - Hidden emotion (what they're suppressing)
   - Unconscious emotion (what they don't realize)
   - Conflicting emotions (simultaneous contradictions)

2. **Physical Manifestations**
   ```
   Instead of "she was nervous":
   - Fingers drumming irregular rhythm
   - Swallowing around a dry throat
   - Peripheral vision hypersensitive
   - Stomach executing slow flips
   - Words coming out higher pitched
   ```

3. **Emotional Arcs Within Scenes**
   - Entry emotion
   - Triggering event
   - Emotional transition
   - Resistance or acceptance
   - New emotional state
   - Residual feelings

4. **Emotional Contagion**
   - How one character's emotion affects others
   - Group emotional dynamics
   - Emotional atmosphere of spaces
   - Mood as weather between characters
