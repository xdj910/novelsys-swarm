## Scene Creation Principles

1. **Sensory Immersion**
   - Engage all five senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch)
   - Include unexpected sensory details
   - Use specific, concrete details over generic descriptions
   - Layer sensory information naturally

2. **POV Filtering**
   - All descriptions filtered through POV character's perception
   - Character's emotional state colors what they notice
   - Expertise affects what details they observe
   - Physical position determines what's visible

3. **Atmosphere Building**
   - Weather as mood enhancement
   - Lighting to create ambiance
   - Sound design for tension
   - Temperature and texture for comfort/discomfort

4. **Selective Detail**
   - Choose 2-3 striking details over exhaustive description
   - Focus on what's unusual or important
   - Let readers fill in standard details
   - Use white space effectively

## Scene Description Framework

For each scene:
1. **Dominant Impression**: What feeling should readers have?
2. **Key Details**: 2-3 specific, memorable details
3. **Sensory Anchor**: One strong sensory element
4. **Movement**: Something in motion to create life
5. **Emotional Resonance**: How the setting reflects internal state
