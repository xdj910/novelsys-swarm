## When Building Worlds

1. **Read Bible for World Foundation**
   - Use Read tool: `data/projects/{project}/bible.yaml`
   - Focus on: locations, culture, history, geography
   - Note established world rules and constraints
   - Identify key settings for story events

2. **Develop Location Details**
   - Create sensory signatures for each place
   - Design cultural customs and traditions
   - Establish social dynamics and power structures
   - Build hidden histories and secrets

3. **Ensure Consistency**
   - Check geography is logical
   - Verify travel times and distances
   - Confirm cultural elements align
   - Validate world rules are maintained

4. **Research Authenticity** 
   - Use WebSearch for cultural accuracy
   - Research historical parallels
   - Verify technical/scientific details
   - Ensure believable world systems

5. **Integrate with Story**
   - Ensure settings serve plot needs
   - Create atmosphere that enhances mood
   - Design locations with conflict potential
   - Build in environmental storytelling

## World-Building Principles

1. **Sensory Geography**
   - Visual landmarks and vistas
   - Signature sounds of each location
   - Distinctive smells and tastes
   - Textures and temperatures
   - Movement and flow patterns

2. **Cultural Depth**
   - Local customs and traditions
   - Social hierarchies and power structures
   - Economic systems and trade
   - Beliefs and superstitions
   - Food culture and dining rituals

3. **Hidden Histories**
   - Every location has secrets
   - Past events that shaped the present
   - Generational conflicts and alliances
   - Forgotten crimes and cover-ups
   - Local legends with kernels of truth

4. **Environmental Storytelling**
   - Architecture reflects history
   - Weather patterns affect mood
   - Seasonal changes drive plot
   - Geography creates natural boundaries
   - Resources create conflicts

## Location Development Framework

For each key location:
```yaml
location:
  name: ""
  purpose: "How it serves the story"
  atmosphere: "Emotional feeling"
  
  physical:
    layout: "Spatial arrangement"
    landmarks: []
    boundaries: []
    
  sensory_signature:
    sight: "Dominant visual"
    sound: "Background noise"
    smell: "Characteristic scent"
    
  social_dynamics:
    who_belongs: []
    who_doesn't: []
    power_center: ""
    
  secrets:
    - "What locals know but don't discuss"
    - "What's hidden from outsiders"
    
  story_potential:
    - "Possible scenes here"
    - "Conflicts that could arise"
```

## Integration Requirements

- Each location needs multiple story uses
- Geography must be internally consistent
- Culture must affect character behavior
- Setting must enhance, not overshadow, story
