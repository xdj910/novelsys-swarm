# Chapter 3: Following the Trail

The morning sun had barely crested the volcanic peaks of La Palma when Sarah Mitchell found herself standing at the entrance to Casa Vista Verde, waiting for Carmen. Her joints protested the early hour-a reminder that her fifty-five-year-old body kept a more honest accounting of time than her mind was willing to acknowledge. The cool mountain air carried hints of pine resin and wild lavender, scents that had already begun to feel like home after mere weeks on the island.

"You're certain about this?" Carmen asked as she pulled up in her weathered Seat Ibiza, concern etching deeper lines around her dark eyes. "The Caldera de Taburiente isn't like the walking paths around Santa Cruz. The terrain can be... unforgiving."

Sarah slid into the passenger seat, ignoring the familiar twinge in her lower back-a souvenir from a fifteen-year-old chase through London's East End that had ended with both criminal and detective in the Thames. "Elena Herrera didn't simply vanish into thin air. That cave we found yesterday-someone's been using it regularly. If Elena knew about it, she might have encountered whoever was there."

"But the sergeant said to wait for the forensics team-"

"The sergeant is following proper procedure," Sarah interrupted gently, recognizing in Carmen's hesitation the same conflict she'd felt countless times-the tension between protocol and instinct. "But every hour that passes reduces our chances of finding Elena alive. You said it yourself yesterday-whoever did this knows these mountains. Well, so did Elena. She hiked these trails regularly, didn't she?"

Carmen nodded reluctantly as she navigated the narrow mountain road, her hands steady despite the emotion Sarah could read in the set of her shoulders. "Every week, sometimes twice. She said the mountains helped her think, helped her remember who she was beneath all the family obligations. 'The caldera doesn't care if you're a Herrera or a nobody,' she used to say. 'It only cares if you respect it.'"

The drive to the Caldera de Taburiente visitor center took forty minutes along roads that seemed carved by a giant's unsteady hand, winding through morning mist that transformed the landscape into something from a dream. Sarah found herself gripping the door handle more than once, though Carmen drove with the casual confidence of someone who'd navigated these curves since childhood, anticipating each hairpin turn with an almost musical rhythm.

"Tell me about Elena's usual routine," Sarah said, partly to distract herself from the precipitous drops visible through her window, where morning clouds clung to cliffsides like torn cotton.

"She always started early, like we are now," Carmen replied, downshifting smoothly as they approached a particularly sharp bend. "She'd park at the visitor center, check in with the rangers-she knew them all by name, their children's names, their problems. Then she'd take the Sendero de los Brecitos trail. It's one of the easier routes, suitable for older hikers." She caught herself, color rising in her cheeks. "I mean-"

Sarah caught the diplomatic phrasing and smiled wryly, the expression feeling more natural than it had in months. "You mean suitable for someone my age."

"I didn't mean-"

"It's alright, Carmen. I'm not naive about my limitations. Twenty-five years of chasing criminals through London didn't exactly leave me with the knees of a marathon runner. But I've learned that experience often compensates for what youth provided effortlessly. The mind sees patterns where young eyes only see chaos."

They reached the visitor center just as it was opening, the first rays of true sunlight painting the volcanic stone building in shades of amber and rose. The structure, constructed from local materials with timber beams that had weathered to silver, seemed to grow organically from the landscape itself. Through the morning haze, Sarah could make out the massive caldera-a colossal natural amphitheater carved by ancient volcanic forces and millennia of patient erosion.

"Dios mío," Sarah breathed, reverting to the Spanish phrases that came more naturally each day. "It's magnificent."

"Eight kilometers across," Carmen said with evident pride, the statistics rolling off her tongue like a prayer learned in childhood. "One of the largest volcanic craters in the world. The Guanche people-our indigenous ancestors-called it Aceró, meaning 'strong place.' They believed it was where the earth's heart beat closest to the surface."

Inside the visitor center, morning light streamed through windows, illuminating dust motes that danced like tiny spirits. A ranger in his fifties looked up from his desk, his weathered face-a map of sun and wind-breaking into a concerned expression when he recognized Carmen.

"Carmen! Any news about Elena?" His voice carried the weight of genuine worry, the kind that came from years of shared morning greetings and trail reports.

"Not yet, Luis. This is Sarah Mitchell-she's helping with the search. Sarah, this is Luis Hernández. He's known Elena for twenty years."

Luis stood, extending a calloused hand that spoke of decades handling ropes and rocks. "Señora Mitchell. Carmen told me about you-the detective from London who bought the old inn." His English was heavily accented but clear, each word carefully chosen. "Elena spoke of you too. She was pleased someone was finally bringing life back to that place. She said it had been waiting for the right person."

"When did you last see Elena?" Sarah asked, noting the genuine worry that creased the corners of his eyes, the way his fingers unconsciously tapped a worried rhythm on his desk.

"Six days ago, Tuesday morning. She came through around seven, same as always. But..." He hesitated, glancing between them as if weighing whether to voice his concerns.

"But what?" Carmen prompted, leaning forward.

"She seemed different. Distracted, perhaps worried. She kept touching this pendant she wore-her grandmother's, I think-the way she did when something was troubling her. When I asked if everything was alright, she said she was working through a family matter. Then she asked an odd question-she wanted to know if I'd noticed anyone unfamiliar on the restricted trails recently, particularly anyone who seemed to be collecting plants or taking photographs of specific areas."

Sarah's investigative instincts sharpened, the familiar electricity of a lead sparking through her fatigue. "Why would she ask that specifically?"

Luis looked uncomfortable, his gaze drifting to a map on the wall marked with various colored pins. "About two weeks before that conversation, Elena had called me, very upset. She'd seen someone on one of her hikes-a man who didn't look like a typical tourist. He was carrying what appeared to be collection equipment: specimen containers, a field press for preserving plants, the kind of GPS unit researchers use. She was concerned he might be illegally harvesting rare plants. She'd been keeping an eye out ever since, documenting any suspicious activity in that notebook she always carried."

"So she was already investigating this before she disappeared," Sarah said, the pieces beginning to fit together like evidence cards on an incident board.

"It seems so. Elena took the protection of our natural heritage very seriously. Her grandmother had been a curandera, you see-a traditional healer. The knowledge of these plants, their uses, their sacred significance-it was passed down through her family like others might pass down jewelry or land. To Elena, someone stealing these plants was like someone robbing graves."

"Did anyone ask about those trails after Elena mentioned her concerns?"

Luis moved to a leather-bound logbook on his desk, his fingers tracing back through pages filled with neat handwriting. "Actually, yes. The week before Elena disappeared, a man came in asking about accessing the old Guanche ceremonial sites. Foreign accent-German or Dutch maybe, that harsh consonant sound. Said he was a researcher, showed me a business card from some institute I'd never heard of, but he didn't have proper credentials from the university or the heritage department."

"Can you describe him?"

"Tall, perhaps forty years old, very fit-the kind of fitness that comes from climbing mountains, not gyms. Expensive hiking equipment-Mammut jacket, Scarpa boots, the kind of gear you see on serious mountaineers, not casual tourists. Very pale blue eyes, almost gray, and a scar here," Luis touched his left eyebrow. "I told him he'd need permits from the heritage department, but..."

"But?"

Luis looked uncomfortable, guilt shadowing his features. "Later that day, I saw him on the Sendero de las Casitas trail. It doesn't lead to the restricted areas directly, but if you know the mountain, you can branch off. I should have reported it, but we were short-staffed, and I thought perhaps I was being paranoid."

Sarah exchanged glances with Carmen. "This trail Elena usually took-the Sendero de los Brecitos-does it connect with any restricted paths?"

"Not officially. But there are old paths, from before the park was formalized. Shepherd trails, smuggler routes from the old days. Elena would know them-her grandfather was a shepherd here before the park existed."

"We need to see Elena's usual route," Sarah said firmly, though her body was already protesting the mere thought.

Luis looked uncertain, his eyes taking in Sarah's age, her city clothes despite the hiking boots. "Señora, with respect, the trail is challenging even for experienced hikers. The altitude alone-we start at nearly two thousand meters. The terrain-"

"I'll manage," Sarah said with more confidence than she felt, drawing on the same reserve of determination that had seen her through her first year as the only woman in her CID unit.

Twenty minutes later, that confidence was being severely tested. The trail began deceptively, a well-maintained path through Canary Island pines whose vanilla-scented bark filled the air with an almost edible sweetness. Sunlight filtered through the canopy, creating a cathedral of light and shadow that would have been peaceful if not for Sarah's laboring lungs.

Within the first kilometer, the gradient increased sharply, and Sarah found her breathing becoming ragged, each inhale burning in the thin mountain air. Her quadriceps burned with an intensity that reminded her why she'd avoided the station gym in her final years on the force.

"We can rest whenever you need," Carmen offered tactfully, though Sarah noticed the younger woman wasn't even breathing hard.

Sarah wanted to refuse, to push through on pride alone, but wisdom-hard-won through age-prevailed. "Just for a moment," she conceded, finding a fallen log worn smooth by countless other rest-seekers.

The view from their rest spot was spectacular enough to justify any number of stops. The caldera spread below them like a giant's bowl, its walls striated with centuries of volcanic history-layers of red, black, and ochre that told the story of the island's violent birth. Morning clouds clung to the peaks, creating an ethereal landscape that seemed more fantasy than reality, as if they'd stepped into a place where the normal rules of the world didn't quite apply.

"Elena loved this view," Carmen said, sitting beside her, her voice soft with memory. "She said it reminded her that human problems were temporary, but the land endured. 'We are just visiting,' she'd say. 'The mountain was here before us and will be here after.'"

"You knew her well."

"She was friends with my grandmother first. Abuela Rosa lived to be ninety-three, sharp until the end. She and Elena would sit for hours on my grandmother's porch, sharing stories about the old days, about how the island had changed. They'd speak in the old dialect sometimes, words I only half understood."

"Tell me about your grandmother," Sarah encouraged, sensing this was important to Carmen, that these memories were a kind of map to understanding the island.

Carmen smiled, a mixture of sadness and warmth crossing her features like sunlight through clouds. "She was formidable. Raised seven children alone after my grandfather died in a fishing accident-his boat caught in a storm off Tazacorte. Never remarried, never complained. She knew every plant on this mountain, every trail, every story. She could predict the weather by the way the clouds gathered around Roque de los Muchachos."

She pointed to a cluster of white flowers growing nearby, their delicate petals trembling in the mountain breeze. "Tajinaste blanco-she taught me that these only grow above two thousand meters, where the clouds kiss the earth. She'd collect them for medicine, but only ever took what she needed, always leaving enough for regeneration. 'The mountain provides,' she'd say, 'but only for those who don't take more than their share.'"

"She sounds like a wise woman."

"She was. She used to say the mountain tested people-not their strength, but their respect. Those who came with arrogance, who thought they could conquer it, often found themselves lost or injured. But those who came with humility, who listened to what the land was telling them..." Carmen trailed off, then stood abruptly. "We should continue if we want to cover Elena's usual route."

They hiked for another hour, the trail winding through stands of pine where the air was thick with resin and the whisper of wind through needles sounded like distant ocean waves. Areas of volcanic gravel shifted treacherously underfoot, each step requiring careful placement. Sarah's legs burned with lactic acid, and she could feel a blister forming on her left heel, the hot spot growing with each step, but she pressed on, drawing on the same determination that had seen her through twenty-five years of cases that others had written off as unsolvable.

"Here," Carmen said suddenly, stopping at a point where the trail curved around a massive boulder whose surface was painted with lichens in shades of green and gold. "This is where Elena would usually rest. She called it her 'thinking rock.'"

Sarah examined the area with professional thoroughness, noting the worn patch on the boulder where countless sittings had polished the stone to a dark sheen. The view from this point encompassed not just the caldera but a glimpse of the ocean beyond, where the morning sun turned the Atlantic into a sheet of hammered silver.

"She'd sketch from here," Carmen added, her voice thick with emotion. "She always carried a small notebook-leather-bound, about this big. Her daughter gave it to her last Christmas."

"Did the investigators find her notebook?"

"No, and that bothered her daughter Rosa terribly. Elena never went anywhere without it. She documented everything-birds she saw, plants in bloom, people she met on the trail. Rosa said finding the notebook would be like finding a piece of her mother's soul."

Sarah was studying the ground around the boulder when something caught her eye-a disturbance in the pine needles, a pattern that didn't match the natural scatter from wind or rain. Her investigative instincts, dormant for months, roared back to life.

"Someone else has been here recently," she said, pointing to the marks. "See how the needles are pushed aside in a deliberate pattern? Someone was searching for something, moving methodically."

Carmen knelt beside her, examining the ground more carefully. "You're right. And look-" She pointed to a partial boot print preserved in a patch of damp earth. "That's not Elena's size. She had tiny feet-size thirty-six. This is at least a forty-two."

They spent several minutes documenting the scene with their phones, Sarah directing Carmen to capture specific angles that would preserve the evidence properly. Then they continued along the trail, both women now hyperalert to any signs of disturbance.

It was another kilometer before they reached the point Luis had mentioned, where an unmarked path branched off from the main trail. The junction was subtle-easy to miss if you didn't know what to look for.

"This leads to the old shepherd paths," Carmen explained, her voice dropping as if the very air here demanded reverence. "They're not maintained anymore, can be dangerous. My grandmother knew them all, but most people have forgotten they exist."

Sarah peered down the overgrown trail, noting fresh breaks in the vegetation, stems bent but not yet brown with age. "Someone's been through here recently. Within the last week, I'd say."

"We shouldn't go alone-"

But Sarah had already started down the path, moving carefully but determinedly, each step calculated despite her exhaustion. Carmen muttered something in Spanish that was probably uncomplimentary but followed, her concern evident in the way she stayed close, ready to steady the older woman if needed.

The old path was treacherous, barely more than a goat track in places. Loose stones skittered away under their feet, clattering down unseen drops that suggested unpleasant falls. Thorny bushes-some type of wild rose, Sarah thought-caught at their clothing with barbed fingers. Sarah's breathing was harsh in her ears, her legs trembling with fatigue, but she pressed on, driven by an instinct honed through decades of investigation-the sense that they were close to something important.

They'd gone perhaps two kilometers when Carmen suddenly stopped. "Mira-look."

Partially hidden beneath a scrub bush was a walking stick, its polished wood gleaming despite a coating of morning dew. Carmen picked it up carefully, handling it with the reverence one might show a religious artifact.

"This is Elena's," she said with absolute certainty. "Her son Miguel made it for her seventieth birthday. See the initials here? EH-Elena Herrera. And these carvings-they tell the story of her life. This spiral here represents her children, these mountains are La Palma, this bird is a Graja, the endemic blue chaffinch. But wait..." She examined it more closely, her face paling. "There's blood on the handle. Dried blood."

Sarah took the stick carefully, her crime scene experience taking over. "The blood pattern suggests she was gripping it tightly when injured. See these smears? They're consistent with a hand wound, possibly defensive. The blood has run into the carved grooves-she held on despite being hurt."

"But why is it here? She would never willingly leave this behind-her knees were getting worse, and she relied on it for stability on rough terrain. She joked that it was her third leg."

"Look at the ground here," Sarah said, pointing to disturbed earth and broken vegetation that told a violent story. "There are signs of a struggle. See these heel marks in the dirt? Someone was dragged. And these broken branches at shoulder height-someone grabbed them, trying to resist. This plant here, the stem is crushed but still green-this happened recently."

Carmen's face had gone pale, the implications sinking in. "You think someone forced her to come with them?"

"The evidence suggests Elena fought back. She held onto her walking stick until she couldn't anymore-either she was overpowered or injured enough that she had to let go. The blood on the handle supports that. But look here-" Sarah pointed to the pattern of disturbance. "She was still on her feet when she left this spot. Dragged, yes, but not carried. That's hopeful."

They searched the immediate area more thoroughly, finding additional evidence that painted an increasingly grim picture-a torn piece of blue fabric caught on thorns that matched the description of Elena's hiking jacket, and more disturbingly, several small blood spatters on nearby rocks, already darkened to rust-brown.

"There was definitely a confrontation here," Sarah said grimly, her mind reconstructing the scene. "Elena encountered someone on this path-unexpected, given how hidden it is. There was a struggle; she tried to defend herself with her walking stick. She was injured-the blood evidence suggests a cut to her hand, likely from trying to grab a weapon or defend against one. Then she was forced to continue without her walking stick."

Carmen's voice was tight with emotion. "We need to call Sergeant Torres."

Sarah pulled out her phone, but the screen showed no signal-they were too deep in the mountains, too far from civilization's digital reach. "We'll have to go back to the visitor center. But first, let's see what's further down this path. If Elena was forced to continue, we need to know where they were taking her."

"Sarah, no. If something violent happened here-"

"Then we need to know what Elena discovered that was worth attacking her for. This isn't her usual route, you said so yourself. She came here following her investigation, tracking someone. And that someone didn't want her to continue."

They proceeded cautiously for another few hundred meters, the path growing even more treacherous. Sarah had to use her hands in places, grabbing at rocks and roots to maintain balance. Her blister had definitely burst now, and she could feel blood seeping into her sock, but she pushed the pain aside.

The path opened into a small clearing dominated by the ruins of an old shepherd's shelter, its stone walls partially collapsed but still providing protection from the elements. The construction was ancient-dry stone fitted without mortar, a technique that went back centuries.

Inside the shelter, they found evidence of recent habitation that didn't belong to any shepherd. A modern sleeping bag-expensive, rated for alpine conditions. Canned goods stacked neatly in a corner, their labels in German. Water bottles, a camp stove, and most tellingly, a collection of plant specimens carefully pressed between sheets of paper, each meticulously labeled with Latin names and GPS coordinates.

"These are the same type of specimens we found in the cave," Sarah observed, examining them without touching. "Same labeling system, same scientific notation. Look at the dates-some of these go back three weeks."

Carmen was examining the canned goods with growing anger. "These are from the German supermarket in Los Llanos. They don't sell these brands in the local shops. An outsider, then. Someone who doesn't even try to be part of our community."

"Our foreign researcher, perhaps? The one Luis described?"

"But what would Elena have to do with plant research?"

Sarah thought back to their conversation with Luis, pieces clicking into place. "Elena had been tracking this person for weeks. She knew someone was illegally harvesting protected plants. The heritage of healers in her family-she would have known exactly what these plants were, their rarity, their value. When she found this shelter, she must have confronted them."

"And they attacked her," Carmen finished, her voice hollow with the weight of understanding.

"It would be in character, wouldn't it? Elena Herrera, matriarch of one of La Palma's oldest families, protector of traditional ways. She discovers someone stealing rare plants from protected sites-plants her grandmother might have used for healing, plants that are part of her family's heritage..."

Carmen's eyes widened with sudden understanding. "She would have felt it was her duty to stop them. The plants of La Palma-some are found nowhere else in the world. My grandmother used to say they were sacred to the Guanche people, that each plant held part of the island's soul. To take them for profit would be like selling pieces of our ancestors."

"And worth a fortune to pharmaceutical companies," Sarah added, her mind racing through similar cases she'd heard about. "Biopiracy-it's more common than people think. These endemic species could contain compounds worth millions. One unique alkaloid, one novel protein, and you're looking at patents worth more than most people see in a lifetime."

They documented everything with their phones, careful not to disturb potential evidence. As they prepared to leave, Sarah noticed something else-a small notebook wedged between two stones, its pages water-stained but still readable.

"This isn't Elena's handwriting," Carmen said, examining it with trembling hands. "It's in German."

Sarah couldn't read German, but she recognized the format-detailed botanical notes, GPS coordinates, chemical formulas, and what looked like extraction procedures. Some pages contained pressed flowers with notes about flowering times and optimal harvest conditions. "We need to get this to the authorities immediately."

The journey back to the visitor center was grueling. Sarah's legs felt like they were made of lead shot, each step an act of will. The burst blister on her heel sent spikes of pain up her leg, and she could feel other hot spots forming. But adrenaline kept her moving, that and the growing certainty that they were finally understanding what had happened to Elena-and that time was running out.

Luis was waiting for them at the visitor center, along with two other rangers. His relief at seeing them was palpable.

"We were about to send a search party," he said, taking in their disheveled appearance. "You've been gone over four hours. The afternoon weather can turn quickly-"

"We need to call Sergeant Torres immediately," Sarah interrupted, urgency overriding courtesy. "We found Elena's walking stick with blood on it, signs of a struggle, and evidence of illegal plant collection. Someone's been using an old shepherd's shelter as a base for biopiracy."

While Carmen made the call, her rapid Spanish growing more agitated as she explained their discoveries, Luis examined the photos on Sarah's phone. His expression grew increasingly grim, aging him ten years in as many seconds.

"These coordinates," he said, pointing to the notebook images with a shaking finger. "They're all in restricted zones. Some of these plants-Dios mío, they're critically endangered. There are less than a hundred specimens of some of these species left in the wild. This one-" he pointed to a delicate white flower, "-Lotus pyranthus, it only grows in three locations on the entire planet, all on this island."

"Would Elena have known that?"

"Of course. She was on the conservation board for years. She gave lectures at the university about endemic species. If she discovered someone stealing these plants..." He shook his head, unable to finish the thought. "She would have been furious. And fearless about confronting them. It wouldn't have mattered to her that she was alone, that she was elderly. The plants would have mattered more than her safety."

Sergeant Torres arrived within an hour, accompanied by a forensics team and what looked like half the island's police force. His earlier skepticism had been replaced by professional intensity, the casual dismissal gone entirely.

"You should have waited for backup," he said, though there was a grudging respect in his tone. "But this is excellent work. The blood on the walking stick-we'll test it immediately, but I'd bet my pension it's Elena's. We've run the partial prints from the cave-they match a German national named Klaus Weber. He has previous arrests for illegal collection of endangered species in Madagascar and Brazil. Interpol has been tracking him for two years."

"Is he still on the island?"

"We're checking now. Border control shows he entered three weeks ago but no departure record. But Señora Mitchell, this changes our approach entirely. If Elena Herrera stumbled onto a biopiracy operation and confronted Weber, if there was a violent struggle..."

"Then she's either being held to prevent her from talking, or..." Sarah didn't finish the sentence, couldn't bring herself to voice the possibility.

"The blood evidence suggests she was injured but mobile," Torres said, studying their photos with professional interest. "The pattern indicates a hand wound, possibly from fighting back. Not life-threatening if treated. We're organizing a full search of the restricted areas, focusing on locations where someone might hide an injured prisoner. Every cave, every shelter, every abandoned building."

"I can help with that," Luis offered immediately. "And there are others-people who learned the old ways from their grandparents. They know caves and shelters that aren't on any official maps. Places where smugglers used to hide, where refugees from the Civil War took shelter. If someone wanted to hide a prisoner..."

As the afternoon sun began its descent toward the Atlantic, painting the caldera walls in shades of gold and crimson, Sarah stood outside the visitor center, looking up at the massive volcanic walls. Somewhere in that vast wilderness, Elena Herrera had made a stand against those who would steal La Palma's natural heritage. The blood on her walking stick testified to her courage-a seventy-eight-year-old woman who hadn't given up without a fight.

Carmen appeared beside her, holding a bottle of water, iodine, and proper bandages. "For your feet," she said simply. "That blister needs attention before it gets infected."

As Sarah sat on a bench to tend to her injuries, carefully cleaning and bandaging the raw skin with the practiced efficiency of someone who'd done this before, Carmen continued, "My grandmother would have liked you. She always said the mountain didn't care where you came from, only what was in your heart. You pushed yourself beyond your limits today for someone you barely know, someone who was a stranger to you a week ago."

"Elena is part of your community. And in a way, I suppose I'm trying to become part of it too. London never felt like home, not really. Just a place where I worked. But here..." Sarah looked around at the mountains, the pines, the vast sky. "Here feels different."

Carmen smiled-the first genuine, warm smile Sarah had seen from her, transforming her face from suspicious to welcoming. "You already are. Come, let's get you back to the inn. Tomorrow will bring new challenges, but tonight, you need rest. And I think perhaps some of my grandmother's arnica salve for those muscles."

As they drove back down the winding mountain road, the setting sun turning the landscape into a tapestry of shadow and light, Sarah reflected on the day's discoveries. They'd found Elena's walking stick and evidence of a violent confrontation, proof of a crime that went beyond simple theft to something darker-the pillaging of irreplaceable natural heritage. But more than that, Sarah had found something she hadn't expected-a connection to this place and its people that went deeper than mere residence. She was becoming woven into the fabric of the island's story.

The walking stick lay in the back seat, wrapped in an evidence bag but still visible-a silent testament to Elena's courage and determination. The blood on its handle told a story of resistance, of an elderly woman who refused to let criminals destroy what she held sacred. Each carved symbol Miguel had lovingly etched into the wood now seemed like a prophecy-Elena's life story wasn't over yet.

"Your grandmother," Sarah said suddenly, breaking the comfortable silence. "You said she believed the mountain tested people's respect, not their strength."

"Sí."

"I think Elena passed that test. She fought to protect what the mountain had entrusted to her people. She earned the mountain's respect through her courage. And I think she's still alive somewhere, waiting for us to prove we deserve to find her."

Carmen nodded slowly, her knuckles white as she gripped the steering wheel. "The blood on the stick-it means she was hurt but not incapacitated. She's tough, Elena. Survived breast cancer ten years ago, buried two husbands, raised four children mostly alone. If anyone could survive injured in those mountains, it would be her. She knows every edible plant, every spring, every shelter."

"Then we keep searching. The mountain may test us, but it also teaches. And one thing it teaches is persistence. Tomorrow, we go back. We search every trail, every cave. We don't stop."

As Casa Vista Verde came into view, its white walls glowing rose-gold in the setting sun, Sarah felt a renewed sense of purpose despite her physical exhaustion. Her body ached in places she'd forgotten existed, her feet throbbed with each heartbeat, and she was more tired than she'd been in years. But she'd also never felt more alive, more connected to a place and a purpose. The months of gray London rain, of emptiness after retirement, seemed like another lifetime.

Elena Herrera was out there somewhere, injured but hopefully alive, and Sarah Mitchell-retired detective from London, transplanted innkeeper of La Palma, newest member of this mountain community-would not stop until she found her.

The mountain had tested her today, and despite the grim discoveries, she had not been found wanting. Tomorrow, with the full weight of the investigation now focused on Klaus Weber and his biopiracy operation, they would test the mountain in return. And Sarah had learned enough about La Palma to know that the mountain, like its people, rewarded those who showed proper respect with revelation.
