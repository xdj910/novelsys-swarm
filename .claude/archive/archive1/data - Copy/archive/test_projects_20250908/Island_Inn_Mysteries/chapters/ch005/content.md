# Chapter 5: The Search Begins

The knock came at 5:47 AM, three tentative taps so soft that Sarah almost missed them beneath the sound of the coffee machine gurgling to life in Casa Vista Verde's kitchen. Her feet, still tender and bandaged from yesterday's mountain ordeal, protested with sharp stabs of pain as she crossed the cool terracotta tiles to open the inn's back door. The hinges, which she'd been meaning to oil for weeks, creaked softly in the pre-dawn stillness.

Maria Herrera stood in the blue-black darkness before dawn, clutching a woolen shawl around her shoulders despite the warm morning air that carried hints of jasmine and sea salt. Her eyes darted nervously toward the road, scanning the shadows as if expecting David's expensive rental car to materialize from the gloom. In the dim light from the kitchen, Sarah could see the woman had been crying-her makeup from yesterday was smudged, suggesting she hadn't slept.

"Come in, quickly," Sarah said, stepping aside and checking the street herself before closing the door.

Maria slipped inside like a frightened cat, her movements quick and furtive. Sarah noticed her hands were trembling, and there was a bruise on her wrist-finger marks, the kind that came from being grabbed too hard.

"I'm sorry to come so early," Maria whispered, though they were alone. "Miguel thinks I'm at the bakery, ordering pastries for the family gathering. I told him I wanted to get there before the tourists bought all the best ones. I don't have much time-maybe twenty minutes before he'll expect me back."

"Coffee?" Sarah offered, already pouring a cup from the pot she'd prepared. The familiar ritual of hospitality seemed to calm Maria slightly, her shoulders dropping from their defensive hunch.

"Gracias." Maria wrapped her hands around the warm ceramic as if drawing strength from it, the steam rising to fog her glasses. She removed them, wiping them with a corner of her shawl-a delaying tactic Sarah recognized from countless witness interviews.

Sarah poured herself a cup and sat across from Maria at the small kitchen table she'd rescued from a flea market in Los Llanos. Through the window, the first hints of dawn were painting the Atlantic horizon in shades of pearl and rose, the lighthouse on Punta Cumplida still flashing its warning to ships.

"Maria," Sarah said gently, using her voice from victim interviews-soft, non-threatening, patient. "What happened to your wrist?"

Maria glanced down, seeming surprised by the bruising. "Miguel. He didn't mean to-he was drunk, upset about David's accusations. He grabbed me when I tried to take away the wine bottle." She pulled her sleeve down to cover the marks. "He's not a bad man, Señora Mitchell. The debts, the pressure, his grandmother missing-it's destroying him."

Sarah nodded, filing the information away. Domestic violence often escalated during family crises, but now wasn't the time to address it. "You said you had information about Elena?"

Maria took a shaky breath, gathering her courage like someone preparing to jump off a cliff. "The old contract Miguel mentioned-it's from 1962. The worst years of the Franco regime, when the island was desperately poor. Elena's father, Don Carlos, signed it during the hardest winter anyone could remember. Half the banana crop had failed, children were going hungry. The contract gave development rights to certain coastal properties in exchange for immediate cash and promises of future prosperity that never came."

"Development rights to whom?" Sarah asked, her detective instincts fully engaged now.

"That's the problem. The company named in the contract-Desarrollo Isleño S.A.-doesn't exist anymore, at least not under that name. But David... David has been tracing the ownership through shell companies, ghost corporations registered in Panama, the Caymans, places where money goes to hide its origins. He's been buying up old contracts like this all over the Canaries through these shells. He finds families in debt, like Miguel, and pressures them to support his interpretations of these old documents."

Sarah's mind was already mapping the connections. "And Elena found out?"

"She's been investigating for months." Maria pulled a small notebook from her purse-Elena's, Sarah recognized from the worn leather cover. "She gave me this two weeks ago, told me to hide it. Said if anything happened to her, I should give it to someone who would know what to do with it."

Sarah took the notebook carefully, as if handling evidence-which it was. Elena's handwriting filled the pages, neat and precise despite her age. Dates, names, financial transactions, property records, environmental assessments. It was the methodical work of someone building a legal case.

"She discovered David was working with foreign investors-the same people behind the hotel development that would destroy the protected cove near Los Cancajos. That cove is a breeding ground for monk seals, Sarah. There are less than 700 left in the world, and they come to our waters to give birth. Elena had proof that environmental impact studies were falsified, that permits were obtained through bribes to officials in Santa Cruz and even Tenerife."

"Klaus Weber," Sarah said suddenly, pieces clicking together. "The German with the plant specimens. Is he connected to this?"

Maria looked surprised, her coffee cup pausing halfway to her lips. "I don't know that name specifically. But Elena mentioned Germans-investors from Hamburg who specialize in 'eco-resorts' that are anything but ecological. They build massive complexes, use up water resources, destroy habitats, then greenwash everything with a few solar panels and recycling bins. They needed rare plant surveys to claim the land had no protected species."

The pieces were falling into place like dominoes. "So they hired someone to remove the evidence-literally. Take the endangered plants so they could claim none existed. A botanical cleansing."

"Elena was going to expose everything. She had documents, recordings she made secretly when David came to pressure her, photographs of the actual protected species. She told me she was keeping them safe until she had enough to take to the authorities in Madrid, beyond David's influence. The local government here-too many people owe David favors or are afraid of the investors he represents."

"Where did she hide them?"

"Her studio, she said. But Sarah..." Maria's voice dropped to a whisper, and she glanced toward the door as if David might be listening. "Yesterday evening, after you left the family dinner, I saw David leaving Elena's house with several banker's boxes. It was past midnight. He had a key. The family doesn't know he went there-everyone was dealing with Miguel's outburst or had gone to bed."

Before Sarah could respond, Carmen burst through the kitchen door, bringing with her the scent of morning dew and urgency. "Sarah, the Civil Guard is here. Inspector Vega wants to-" She stopped abruptly, noticing Maria. "Maria? What are you doing here?"

Maria stood quickly, nearly knocking over her coffee, the dark liquid sloshing dangerously. "I should go. Miguel will wonder-"

"Wait," Sarah said, gently but firmly. "Maria, would you testify to what you've told me? Would you share Elena's notebook with the authorities?"

Fear flashed across Maria's face like lightning, raw and primal. "I... I have children, Sarah. Three children. Miguel's debts, if David calls them in... We could lose everything. The house, their school fees, everything. And the people David works with-Elena was afraid of them, and she was the bravest woman I know."

"I understand," Sarah said gently, though frustration gnawed at her. "But think about Elena. She stood up to David to protect this island's future. Can we do any less?"

Maria hesitated at the door, her hand on the handle, torn between flight and fight. "Let me think about it. Maybe... maybe if Miguel were somewhere safe, if the children were protected... But please, be careful. David has connections everywhere-the courts, the police, the banks. And if he's desperate enough to harm his own aunt..." She touched the bruise on her wrist unconsciously. "Violence runs in that family, just usually it's wrapped in legal documents instead of physical force."

She didn't finish the sentence. She didn't need to. The implication hung in the air like smoke.

After Maria slipped out the back door, Sarah quickly updated Carmen on the conversation, showing her Elena's notebook. Carmen's face grew increasingly grim as she flipped through the pages.

"This is enormous," Carmen breathed. "Elena was documenting everything-illegal construction permits going back five years, bribes to the environmental protection board, threatened species being deliberately eliminated. Look at this-" She pointed to a page. "She even tracked where the money was flowing. Swiss accounts, Caribbean shells, a web of corruption that reaches to Madrid."

"We need to get this to Inspector Vega immediately," Sarah said, then paused. "Carmen, where exactly is Elena's studio?"

"It's not at her house," Carmen said. "She converted an old goat shed on the family's agricultural land into an art studio about ten years ago. Very few people know about it-she valued her privacy when she painted. It's about two kilometers from the main house, up a dirt track."

Sarah felt a spark of hope. "Would David know about it?"

Carmen considered. "Maybe, but would he think to look there? Elena always called it her sanctuary, her place to escape family drama."

Before they could discuss further, Inspector Vega entered the kitchen without ceremony, his uniform crisp despite the early hour. His expression was professional but with an underlying excitement Sarah recognized-the look of an investigator who'd found a significant lead.

"Señora Mitchell," Vega greeted her with more warmth than he'd shown previously, the respect earned by yesterday's discoveries. "The Guardia Civil helicopter will arrive within the hour. We're organizing search teams to cover the restricted areas you identified yesterday. The forensics team has also processed the blood on Elena's walking stick-it's definitely hers, but the wound pattern suggests defensive injuries, not a fall."

"She fought back," Sarah said, not surprised.

"It appears so. How can you help today?"

"Actually, I was hoping to use your inn as a coordination center for the volunteer searchers. We're expecting over a hundred people, possibly more. The community response has been overwhelming."

Sarah didn't hesitate. "Of course. Carmen and I will provide coffee and sandwiches for the volunteers. We have the space and the kitchen capacity."

Vega looked relieved. "Gracias. Your work yesterday-finding the walking stick, identifying the illegal collection site-it's given us our first real leads. The prosecutor in Santa Cruz is very interested."

"Inspector," Sarah said, pulling him aside and lowering her voice. "There's something you need to see." She showed him Elena's notebook, watching his eyes widen as he understood what he was looking at.

"Where did you get this?"

"It was given to me by someone who wants to remain anonymous for now. But it's genuine-Elena's handwriting, her documentation method. She was building a case against her nephew David and his associates."

Vega studied the pages intently. "This changes everything. This isn't just a missing person case-it's potentially murder to cover up massive corruption." He looked up at Sarah. "I need to make some calls to Madrid. This is beyond local jurisdiction now."

By 8 AM, Casa Vista Verde had transformed into a bustling command center that would have impressed Sarah's old colleagues at Scotland Yard. The dining room walls were covered with topographical maps marked with search grids in different colored pins. Carmen had recruited what seemed like half her extended family to help in the kitchen, and the aroma of fresh coffee and bocadillos filled the air, mixing with the sounds of determined conversation in Spanish, English, and German.

Sarah found herself naturally falling into an organizational role, her command presence from years of leading investigations asserting itself. Her years of coordinating complex investigations in London translated surprisingly well to managing volunteer search efforts. She set up a check-in system using cards and a board she'd found in the inn's storage, created communication protocols using WhatsApp groups for different search areas, and established an information flow chart that impressed even Inspector Vega.

"You've done this before," he observed, watching her efficiently direct volunteers to their assigned areas while simultaneously managing three phone conversations.

"Different context, same principles," Sarah replied, marking off another search team on her master list. "Clear communication, defined responsibilities, regular check-ins. Whether you're hunting a serial killer in London or searching for a missing woman in La Palma, coordination is key."

The volunteers were a mix that warmed Sarah's heart-locals who'd known Elena all their lives, tourists who'd heard about the search and wanted to help, expatriates from the British and German communities offering their hiking expertise. A German couple, the Müllers, who'd been at the festival where Sarah first encountered the mystery, insisted on joining despite the language barrier. They'd actually met Elena while hiking and she'd shared her knowledge of local plants with them.

"She was so passionate," Frau Müller explained in careful English. "She showed us the Phoenix canariensis, explained how the ancient people used every part of the palm. We cannot sit in our hotel while she is missing."

British retirees from the expatriate community offered their walking group's intimate knowledge of coastal paths not on any official map. "We've been hiking these trails for fifteen years," their leader, a former RAF officer named Thompson, explained. "We know caves and shelters that aren't in any guidebook."

Even teenagers from the local school had been given permission to help with the lower-risk areas. Sarah watched them arrive in groups, their usual teenage slouch replaced by serious determination. Elena had taught art classes at the school, apparently, inspiring a generation of young Palmeros to see their island through an artist's eyes.

"It's beautiful, really," Carmen said, pausing beside Sarah to survey the organized chaos. "Elena touched so many lives. People want to help because she helped them-teaching their children, preserving their traditions, fighting for their island's future."

Around noon, as the sun reached its zenith and search teams were rotating for lunch breaks, a man Sarah didn't recognize entered the inn. He was perhaps fifty, with the sun-weathered skin of someone who worked outdoors and intelligent eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses. He wore the casual but expensive clothing-Columbia hiking pants, a Patagonia shirt-of someone who worked in environmental sciences. There was an urgency to his movements that immediately caught Sarah's attention.

"I'm looking for Sarah Mitchell," he said in accented English-educated, precise.

"I'm Sarah."

"Luis Montero-no relation to the inspector. I run Canarias Ecológica, an environmental protection organization based in Tenerife. I heard about Elena's disappearance on the news this morning. I think I might have relevant information that wasn't safe to share over the phone."

Sarah's instincts prickled. She led him to a quiet corner of the terrace, away from the search coordination chaos. The view from here encompassed the Atlantic and the distant silhouette of Tenerife, a reminder of how these islands were connected beneath the waves. Luis pulled out a tablet, encrypted she noticed, showing her a series of documents.

"Elena contacted me six weeks ago," he began, his voice low and urgent. "She'd discovered something troubling about coastal development applications throughout La Palma. Several protected areas were being redesignated based on environmental surveys that seemed... questionable is too mild a word. Fraudulent would be more accurate."

"Questionable how?" Sarah asked, though Elena's notebook had already given her some answers.

"Species that we knew existed were absent from the reports. Geological assessments that contradicted decades of previous studies. Most damning, signature pages that had been digitally altered-we ran forensic analysis on the PDFs. Elena suspected the surveys were falsified. She was particularly concerned about a cove near Los Cancajos-it's not just a breeding ground for several endangered plant species, but also a nursery area for monk seals. If that habitat is destroyed..."

He trailed off, but Sarah understood. The loss would be catastrophic for an already critically endangered species.

"Elena was building a case," Luis continued, swiping through more documents. "She'd been photographing the sites weekly, documenting the actual species present, comparing them to the filed reports. She had time-stamped, GPS-tagged photographs that proved the reports were lies. She told me she had proof of deliberate fraud that reached the highest levels of the Canarian government."

"Did she say where she was keeping this proof?"

"She was careful about that, even with me. Said she'd hidden it where only someone who truly knew her would think to look. 'Where my heart lives,' she said. She was frightened, Señora Mitchell. The last time we spoke, three days before she disappeared, she said she thought someone had been in her house while she was out. Small things moved, her computer accessed. She was planning to leave the island, go to Madrid directly."

"When was she planning to leave?"

"The day after she disappeared. She had a ticket booked on the morning flight to Madrid, then a meeting scheduled with journalists from El País and environmental lawyers from the EU commission. She was going to blow this wide open."

Sarah felt a chill despite the warm afternoon sun streaming through the terrace's vine-covered pergola. Elena had been days, perhaps hours, away from exposing a massive fraud, and now she was missing. And according to Maria, David had already been to Elena's house, removing boxes of who knew what.

"Would you be willing to share this information with Inspector Vega?" Sarah asked.

"Already have, an hour ago. But between you and me, Señora Mitchell, I don't trust the local system. Too many connections, too much money involved. I've been doing this work for twenty years-I've seen how these things get buried. Elena knew this, which is why she was going to Madrid, beyond the reach of local influence."

After Luis left, promising to stay in touch, Sarah found herself standing on the terrace, looking out at the search teams visible on the distant hillsides like ants working with purpose. Helicopters swept back and forth over the Caldera, their rhythmic thrum a constant reminder of the urgency. Each passing hour reduced the chances of finding Elena alive.

Rosa Herrera appeared beside her, looking haggard. She'd aged years in the past two days, stress etching lines that makeup couldn't hide. "Any news?"

"The search teams are being thorough," Sarah said carefully, not wanting to raise false hopes. "Rosa, can I ask you something? Your mother's studio-has anyone been there since she disappeared?"

Rosa frowned, considering. "No, it's been locked. Mamá was very private about her art space. Only she had a key. It's her sanctuary, she always said."

"You're certain no one else has access?"

"Well..." Rosa paused, conflict clear on her face. "David asked about it yesterday, wanted to check if Mamá had left any indication of where she might have gone. But I told him I didn't have a key, which is true."

Sarah chose her words carefully. "Might David have had his own key?"

Rosa's face paled as implications dawned. "He shouldn't have. Unless..." She trailed off, then shook her head. "No, that's impossible. But..."

"What?"

"Years ago, when Papá died, David helped manage the estate. He had keys to everything then-the house, the properties, even the safety deposit box. But that was fifteen years ago. Surely he wouldn't still... But then, David never gives up an advantage, does he?"

She didn't finish, but her expression said she was reconsidering many things about her cousin, re-evaluating past interactions through a new, darker lens.

Inspector Vega appeared in the doorway, his expression tense with suppressed excitement. "Señora Mitchell, we've found something significant."

Sarah's heart leaped. "Elena?"

"No, but perhaps the key to finding her. The German, Klaus Weber-we've located where he was staying. A rental cottage near the botanical garden in Los Llanos. The owner says he left suddenly three days ago, middle of the night, but his things are still there. We're heading there now. Would you like to come? Your observational skills might be useful."

Sarah glanced at Carmen, who nodded immediately. "Go. I'll manage things here. The volunteers know what they're doing now."

The rental cottage was a small, traditional building with blue wooden shutters, surrounded by banana plantations whose leaves rustled in the afternoon breeze. It looked innocent enough from the outside, even charming, but the interior told a different story entirely.

Scientific equipment covered every surface-plant presses with specimens in various stages of preservation, labeled specimen bags with dates and GPS coordinates, detailed botanical charts annotated in German, and a sophisticated laptop setup with multiple external drives. The smell of preserving chemicals hung in the air.

"He wasn't just collecting," Sarah observed, careful not to touch anything without gloves. "He was analyzing, categorizing, preparing for transport. This is a professional operation."

Inspector Vega held up a notebook, similar to Elena's but filled with German text. "Look at this-it's a commission list. Someone was paying him to collect specific species, all of them endangered, all of them from areas slated for development."

Sarah photographed the pages with her phone, her German limited but sufficient to understand the key points. One entry caught her eye: "E. Herrera interference-employer notified-awaiting instructions. Woman is persistent, knows mountains well. May need intervention."

"He reported Elena to whoever hired him," she said, her voice tight with anger. "Inspector, this wasn't random. Someone hired Weber specifically to clear protected species from development sites. Elena caught him, confronted him, and he reported her as a problem to be solved."

"The question is who hired him."

But Sarah thought she knew. The timing, the locations, the connection to the fraudulent environmental reports-it all pointed to David Herrera and his investors. Elena had stumbled onto their scheme and become a threat that needed to be eliminated.

"Inspector," Sarah said, studying the equipment more carefully. "Some of these specimens are still fresh-collected within the last week. If Weber left three days ago..."

"He had help," Vega finished. "Someone else is continuing the collection. Or..."

"Or he's still on the island, just moved to a different location. Somewhere more secure."

As they returned to Casa Vista Verde, Sarah's phone rang. It was Carmen, and she sounded shaken, her usual composure cracked.

"Sarah, you need to come back immediately. Something's happened. David is here."

Sarah found the inn in chaos. Volunteers were clustered in agitated groups, voices raised in anger and confusion. At the center of it all, David Herrera stood in the dining room like a king holding court, addressing the crowd with his lawyer's voice-smooth, authoritative, designed to command compliance.

"-appreciate your efforts, but the family has decided to call off the search. We believe Elena, in her confused state, may have had an accident. We're offering a substantial reward-fifty thousand euros-for any information, but we ask that people stop these dangerous search activities immediately. The liability issues alone-"

"You can't do that," Sarah said loudly, pushing through the crowd, her voice cutting through his smooth patter like a blade.

David turned to her with a cold smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Señora Mitchell. I can and I have. As Elena's legal representative with power of attorney and the family's spokesperson, I'm requesting that all search activities cease immediately. It's for everyone's safety."

"Inspector Vega-"

"Has been recalled to Santa Cruz. A more senior officer is taking over the case, someone who understands the delicate nature of the situation and the family's wishes."

Sarah felt the trap closing like walls pressing in. David was using his influence to shut down the search, probably because they were getting too close to something. But what could she do? She was, as David had repeatedly pointed out, an outsider with no legal standing.

"You're wrong," a voice said from the doorway, loud and clear.

Miguel stood there, swaying slightly but more sober than Sarah had seen him in days. His clothes were rumpled but clean, his face shaved. Beside him stood Maria, her chin raised despite her obvious fear, her hand holding his for support.

"I'm Elena's grandson," Miguel continued, his voice gaining strength. "Her blood. And I say the search continues. Abuela is out there, alive, waiting for us to find her, and we're going to find her."

"You're drunk and in debt," David said dismissively, his mask slipping to show irritation. "No one's going to listen to-"

"They'll listen to this," Rosa said, stepping forward with a manila envelope that trembled in her hands. "I went to Mamá's real studio-the one at the old farm, not the room at her house. I found where she hid her insurance-behind that painting of Abuela cooking, just like the clue she left. 'Her mother's recipes,' she said. She meant the recipe for truth."

She pulled out documents, photographs, USB drives. "It's all here. The real environmental reports showing protected species. The bribery records with amounts and dates. The proof that you've been selling out our island's future for profit. Emails between you and the German investors discussing how to 'handle' the Elena problem."

David's composure finally cracked completely, his face flushing red. "You don't know what you're dealing with. The people involved in this-they don't just make problems disappear. They make people disappear. You're putting yourselves in danger!"

"Like you made Elena disappear?" Sarah asked quietly, the accusation hanging in the air like a sword.

The room went silent. Even the coffee machine seemed to pause its gurgling.

David's face went from red to pale. "I never touched her. Yes, I was involved in the development deals. Yes, some shortcuts were taken with the environmental assessments. But I wouldn't hurt my own aunt. She's family!"

"But you'd let someone else do it," Sarah said, her voice carrying the authority of decades of interrogations. "You told Weber's employer about Elena's interference. You knew what might happen. You gave them her routines, her hiking schedule. You set her up."

"I thought they'd just scare her, make her back off!" David exploded, the truth finally spilling out. "A warning, maybe take her notebook, destroy her evidence. I didn't think-I didn't know they'd-" He stopped, realizing he'd said too much.

Inspector Vega stepped out from behind a group of volunteers where he'd been listening. "David Herrera, you're under arrest for conspiracy to commit fraud, environmental crimes, bribery of public officials, and possible involvement in the disappearance and endangerment of Elena Herrera."

As the Civil Guard led David away, his expensive shoes scuffing on the terracotta tiles, Sarah felt a mix of satisfaction and frustration. They'd exposed the conspiracy, but Elena was still missing. And now, with David's admission that dangerous people were involved, the urgency was even greater.

"The search continues," Inspector Vega announced to the assembled volunteers, his voice carrying new authority. "We now have evidence that Elena Herrera is not confused or lost-she's been targeted for exposing corruption. She's a hero who risked everything to protect this island. We will find her."

The crowd erupted in renewed determination. Search teams reorganized with military precision, now armed with better information about where Elena might have gone to hide evidence or escape threats. The German connection meant they needed to check properties owned or rented by foreign nationals. The corruption investigation meant Elena might have sought sanctuary with trusted friends off the official grid.

As the sun began to set over the Atlantic, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink that would have made Elena reach for her paintbrush, Sarah stood on the terrace of Casa Vista Verde, watching the volunteers spread out across the landscape once more. Her feet still hurt-the blisters had reopened despite fresh bandages-her body was exhausted, but her spirit was energized with purpose.

"You did it," Carmen said, joining her with two glasses of wine-a good Malvasía from a local vineyard. "You turned a missing person case into an environmental investigation and exposed corruption that's probably been going on for years. You gave this community its power back."

"We did it," Sarah corrected, accepting the wine gratefully. "The whole community. And we haven't succeeded yet. Elena is still out there somewhere."

"But now we know why she disappeared. She wasn't confused or senile like David claimed. She was brave, standing up to powerful interests despite the danger."

Sarah nodded, thinking about the woman she'd barely known but had come to deeply respect. Elena Herrera had risked everything to protect her island home. The bloodstained walking stick, the hidden evidence, the careful documentation-it all painted a picture of a woman who knew she was in danger but refused to back down.

"Carmen," Sarah said suddenly, a thought occurring to her. "Maria said Elena told her the evidence was hidden 'where her heart lives.' We assumed that meant her studio, her art. But what if it meant something else?"

"Like what?"

"Where would Elena's heart truly live? Not in things, but in..."

"The land," Carmen breathed. "The protected places she was trying to save. She wouldn't just hide evidence-she'd hide herself in the one place she knew better than anyone, the one place that mattered most to her."

"The cove near Los Cancajos. The monk seal breeding ground she was protecting."

They looked at each other, the same thought occurring simultaneously.

"We need to search there," Sarah said. "At first light, before anyone else thinks of it."

Tomorrow, the search would continue with renewed purpose and direction. Tonight, Casa Vista Verde would remain open all night, feeding and supporting the volunteers who refused to give up. Sarah would coordinate with Inspector Vega, plan a search of the cove, and pray they weren't too late.

The community had been tested today, and it had responded with unity and determination that would have made Elena proud. Whatever tomorrow brought, they would face it together.

As Sarah limped back into the inn to continue coordinating the search, she thought about how she'd come to La Palma seeking peace and solitude, a quiet retirement running a small inn. Instead, she'd found purpose, community, and a case that mattered. Elena Herrera had given her that gift, even in absence.

Now it was time to repay it by bringing Elena home.
