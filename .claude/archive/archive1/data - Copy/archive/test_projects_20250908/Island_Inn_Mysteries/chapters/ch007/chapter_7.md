# Chapter 7: The Rescue Plan

*POV: Sarah Mitchell*

## 10:00 PM - Casa Vista Verde Command Center

The warm glow of Casa Vista Verde's main lounge had transformed into something resembling a war room. Sarah stood before the large dining table, now covered with hand-drawn maps, tourist brochures, and Carmen's laptop displaying satellite images of the Tazacorte area. The cheerful yellow walls and tropical artwork seemed incongruous with the gravity of their situation.

"Twenty-two hours," Sarah announced, checking her watch. The kidnapper's deadline loomed like a thundercloud. "We need to assume they meant exactly twenty-four hours from that call."

Carmen closed her laptop with a decisive click. "The guest rooms on the second floor are empty. We can use them as staging areas if needed." Her voice carried the steady authority of someone accustomed to managing crises, though Sarah noticed the slight tremor in her hands as she poured coffee.

Inspector Vega sat heavily in one of the wicker chairs, his usually pristine uniform rumpled from the long day. "I want to be clear about my position here," he said carefully. "Officially, I cannot sanction a civilian rescue operation. Unofficially..." He met Sarah's eyes. "I have three patrol cars that will be conveniently delayed in responding to any disturbance calls from the Tazacorte area tomorrow."

Tomás emerged from the kitchen carrying a thermos and what looked like a military-surplus backpack. At sixty-two, the former mountain guide still moved with the sure-footed grace of someone who had spent decades navigating La Palma's treacherous volcanic terrain. "I know those banana plantations like my own garden," he said in accented English, switching from the rapid Spanish he'd been speaking with Carmen. "Been hunting wild boar there since I was fifteen. If Elena is where we think she is, I can get us close without being seen."

Sarah spread out the largest map-a detailed topographical survey Carmen had found in her office files. "Show me."

Tomás traced a weathered finger along a winding path marked in faded green ink. "This old trail connects to the GR-131 hiking route. It was used by plantation workers before the tourism boom. Most of it's overgrown now, but it provides cover from the main road." He pointed to a cluster of rectangular shapes on the map. "These are the old storage buildings. If they're holding someone, it would be here-isolated but still accessible by vehicle."

Sarah studied the layout with the focused intensity that had made her one of Boston's most effective detectives. Something wasn't quite right about the kidnappers' choice of location. "It's almost too obvious," she murmured. "An abandoned plantation near where they were last seen. Either they're not as smart as they think, or..."

"Or they want us to find it," Carmen finished grimly.

"Possibly. But we're running out of options." Sarah pulled out her phone and activated a video call. "Ana? Are you there?"

The screen flickered to life, revealing Ana Morales in what appeared to be her home office in Madrid. Even at past midnight Spanish time, the lawyer looked impeccably professional, though Sarah could see the worry lines around her eyes.

"Sarah, Carmen," Ana's voice crackled through the connection. "I've been monitoring news feeds and social media. Nothing about Elena's disappearance has leaked publicly yet, which is good. It gives us room to maneuver."

Sarah leaned closer to the phone. "We need you to sell a performance tomorrow, Ana. Can you manage that?"

"What kind of performance?"

"You're going to announce that you're suspending all legal action regarding the land development project. Make it public, make it convincing. The kidnappers need to believe they've won."

Ana was quiet for a long moment. "That will be... difficult. My clients won't understand. The media will ask questions."

"Can you make it believable without actually withdrawing the case?" Sarah pressed. "Some kind of legal technicality that gives you room to reverse course later?"

A slow smile spread across Ana's face. "A temporary injunction suspension pending environmental review. Yes, I can make that work. It buys time without actually conceding anything substantial."

"Perfect. How quickly can you make this public?"

"I can have a press release ready by 8 AM tomorrow, coordinate with the local media by 9 AM. But Sarah..." Ana's expression grew serious. "If this goes wrong, if Elena is hurt, the legal ramifications could be severe. Are you certain about this approach?"

Sarah met Carmen's eyes across the table. "We're certain. Elena trusted us enough to call yesterday. We're not going to let her down."

After ending the call, the room fell into contemplative silence. Outside, Sarah could hear the gentle crash of waves against the rocks below-a sound that had become comforting over the past week but now seemed to emphasize their isolation.

"There's something else," Inspector Vega said quietly. "I ran the license plate from that rental car through our system. It was paid for with a credit card registered to a shell company based in Panama. Professional work."

Sarah's detective instincts sharpened. "How professional are we talking?"

"Professional enough to use proper operational security, not professional enough to avoid leaving digital traces. I'd say competent amateurs rather than career criminals."

"That's actually good news," Sarah mused. "Career criminals would have killed Elena already rather than risk a prolonged negotiation. Amateurs might make mistakes we can exploit."

## 11:30 PM - Final Preparations

Carmen had transformed the inn's business office into a communications hub. Her landline, mobile phone, and laptop were all connected to various charging cables snaking across the desk. "I've prepared three different versions of tomorrow's schedule," she explained, handing Sarah a folder. "The public version shows normal guest activities. The staff version has everyone off-duty by noon. The real version..."

Sarah opened the folder to find a minute-by-minute timeline covering the next fourteen hours. It was impressively detailed, from the 3 AM reconnaissance mission to contingency plans for various emergency scenarios.

"You should have been a military planner," Sarah said admiringly.

"I learned crisis management the hard way, during the volcanic eruption two years ago. This island teaches you to be ready for anything."

Tomás returned from outside, carrying what looked like professional hiking equipment. "Rope, first aid, emergency flares, and these," he said, producing two compact radio handsets. "Range is about five kilometers in open terrain, less in the mountains, but they should work for our purposes."

Sarah examined one of the radios. "Where did you get military-grade equipment?"

"I guide rescue operations for the Guardia Civil sometimes. They trust me with their backup gear." He grinned. "What they don't know is that I never return all of it."

Inspector Vega stood up, straightening his uniform. "I need to leave now and make a very public show of scaling back the search operation. By morning, half the island should know that the police are 'giving up' on the Elena Martinez case due to lack of evidence."

"Will people believe that?" Sarah asked.

"They'll believe what they want to believe. And what most people want to believe is that their quiet island doesn't have room for serious crime." Vega moved toward the door, then paused. "Sarah, I want you to know-if this were my daughter missing, I'd probably be doing exactly what you're doing. But I also want you to understand the risks. If someone gets hurt tomorrow..."

"They won't," Sarah said with more confidence than she felt. "We're going to bring Elena home safely."

After Vega left, the three remaining conspirators spent another hour refining their plan. Sarah found herself impressed by the meticulous attention to detail both Carmen and Tomás brought to the operation. Living on an island where help might be hours away had clearly taught them the value of thorough preparation.

## 3:00 AM - Pre-Dawn Reconnaissance

The alarm on Sarah's phone buzzed softly in the darkness. She had managed perhaps two hours of fitful sleep, her mind constantly churning through potential complications and alternative scenarios. The old detective habit of mental rehearsal had kicked in automatically.

Carmen was already awake, sitting by the window with a cup of coffee. "Couldn't sleep either?" she asked softly.

"Too many variables," Sarah admitted, pulling on the dark clothing Tomás had recommended. "In Boston, I had backup, forensic support, legal authority. Here, we're improvising with garden tools and good intentions."

"Don't underestimate the value of local knowledge and community support," Carmen said. "This island has a way of protecting its own."

They met Tomás in the inn's parking area, where he had prepared a small hiking pack and checked the radio equipment one final time. The night air was cool and crisp, with a light breeze carrying the scent of volcanic soil and wild herbs from the hills above.

"The moon sets in forty minutes," Tomás reported. "That will give us optimal darkness for the approach, but we need to be in position before dawn starts lighting the eastern sky."

They loaded into Carmen's SUV, choosing it over Sarah's rental car for its better off-road capability and local license plates. As they drove through the sleeping village of Los Llanos, Sarah felt a familiar tightening in her chest-the pre-operation tension she remembered from her police days.

The drive to Tazacorte took twenty minutes on winding mountain roads. Tomás directed Carmen to a barely visible dirt track that branched off from the main highway about two kilometers before the town. "Park here," he instructed. "We walk from this point."

Sarah shouldered her pack and followed Tomás into what seemed like impenetrable vegetation. But within a few steps, she realized he was following an actual path, invisible to her untrained eye but clearly well-defined to someone with his experience.

"This trail was used by banana workers for sixty years," he explained in a whisper as they climbed steadily upward. "Faster than the main road, and it keeps you out of sight from the plantations below."

The hike took forty-five minutes through terrain that alternated between dense subtropical forest and open volcanic rock formations. Sarah's Boston-honed fitness served her well, but she found herself grateful for Tomás's steady pace and sure footing.

As they crested a ridge overlooking the abandoned plantation, the eastern horizon was just beginning to show the first hints of gray light. Tomás led them to a natural observation point behind a cluster of large volcanic boulders.

"There," he breathed, pointing to a collection of buildings spread across the valley floor below.

Sarah pulled out the compact binoculars Carmen had provided and studied the scene. The abandoned banana plantation stretched across perhaps twenty acres, with several large corrugated metal buildings that had once served as packing and storage facilities. Most were clearly empty and deteriorating, but one-the largest building near the center of the complex-showed signs of recent activity.

## 4:30 AM - Confirmation and Analysis

"I see movement," Sarah whispered into her radio, keeping her voice barely above a breath. Through the binoculars, she had spotted a figure walking between two of the buildings-the first confirmation that their target location was correct.

Carmen's voice crackled back softly through the radio. "How many?"

Sarah continued her systematic surveillance, noting details with the methodical approach that had made her an effective detective. "At least two, possibly three individuals. One appears to be on regular patrol-he's walking a circuit that takes about twelve minutes. There's a white sedan parked behind the main building, but I can also see what looks like a blue hatchback partially concealed under some kind of tarp."

This was significant. The blue hatchback matched witness descriptions of the vehicle seen near Elena's hotel the day she disappeared.

"Any sign of Elena?" Carmen's voice carried barely controlled tension.

Sarah adjusted her binoculars and focused on the main building's windows. Most were boarded up or too dirty to see through, but one section of the structure had what appeared to be newer plywood coverings with small gaps.

"Wait," she murmured, and then felt her heart jump. Through one of the gaps, she caught a glimpse of movement that didn't match the guard patrol pattern. Someone was inside the main building, and given the confined nature of their movement, it was almost certainly a prisoner.

"I think I see her," Sarah reported. "Someone's in the main building, appears to be restrained or confined."

Tomás touched her shoulder and pointed toward the eastern edge of the plantation. "Guard rotation," he whispered. "Watch."

Sarah swiveled the binoculars and saw a second figure emerge from what looked like a small trailer or mobile office. The two guards met, spoke briefly, and then the original patrol guard disappeared into the trailer while the second man began walking the same circuit.

"Shift change every twelve minutes," Sarah noted. "That's professional enough to maintain consistent security, but the timing is mechanical rather than varied. They're following a pattern we can predict."

She continued her observation, noting every detail that might prove useful. The guards appeared to be carrying what looked like handguns, but no automatic weapons or professional tactical equipment. Their movements suggested familiarity with the location but not military or police training.

Most importantly, Sarah noticed something the kidnappers themselves might not have realized: the main building had two entrances. The front entrance was clearly visible and well-guarded, but the rear of the building, partially hidden by overgrown vegetation and old equipment, had what appeared to be a loading dock with a separate door.

"There's another way in," she told Tomás. "Back side of the building. Can we approach it without being seen?"

Tomás studied the terrain through his own binoculars. "Yes, but it would mean crossing about fifty meters of open ground. Risky, but possible during the guard rotation."

Sarah continued her surveillance until the sky grew bright enough to make their position potentially visible from below. By 5:30 AM, she had compiled a detailed intelligence picture: two guards in rotation, two vehicles, one prisoner in the main building, and a vulnerable rear entrance that could provide access during the brief gaps in surveillance coverage.

## 6:00 AM - Return and Planning

The hike back to the vehicle seemed shorter, perhaps because Sarah's mind was racing with tactical possibilities. She had seen enough to confirm that a rescue operation was feasible, though certainly not without risk.

Carmen was waiting anxiously in the SUV, engine running and heater on against the morning chill. "Well?" she asked the moment they appeared.

"Elena's there," Sarah confirmed. "And we can get to her. But we'll need help."

During the drive back to Casa Vista Verde, Sarah outlined what she had observed and began sketching the framework of a rescue plan. The key would be timing and distraction-creating enough confusion to approach the building undetected while ensuring Elena's safety during the extraction.

"We need people who know the terrain and aren't afraid to take risks," Sarah explained. "But they also need to understand that this isn't a game. Someone could get hurt."

Carmen nodded grimly. "I know exactly who to call."

## 8:00 AM - The Deception Campaign

Back at the inn, Carmen had prepared breakfast with the focused efficiency of someone channeling nervous energy into productive action. Sarah found herself grateful for the strong coffee and simple meal, knowing it might be many hours before they had another chance to eat properly.

Ana Morales called precisely at 8 AM, as promised. "The press release is ready," she reported. "I'm announcing a temporary suspension of all legal action pending a comprehensive environmental impact assessment. It sounds official and gives the impression that we're backing down, but it actually just delays everything by sixty days."

"Perfect," Sarah said. "How are you handling media questions?"

"I'm suggesting that new environmental concerns have emerged that require careful study before proceeding. Boring enough that most reporters won't dig deeper, but plausible enough to satisfy anyone who's paying attention."

Carmen had been monitoring local radio and social media throughout the morning. "Inspector Vega's performance was convincing," she reported. "Half the island is talking about how the police have given up searching for Elena Martinez. The consensus seems to be that she probably left voluntarily and the authorities are too embarrassed to admit they wasted resources on a false alarm."

Sarah felt a grudging admiration for how effectively they had managed to manipulate public perception in less than twelve hours. But she also knew that their window of opportunity was limited. Once the kidnappers realized Elena was still missing after receiving their supposed victory, they would either flee or escalate.

"How long do you think we have before they start questioning the situation?" she asked.

Carmen considered this carefully. "If Ana's announcement hits the local news by 9 AM, and if Inspector Vega maintains his public posture of scaling back the investigation, maybe until afternoon. But not longer than that."

The timeline was tight, but workable. Sarah checked her watch: 8:15 AM. In less than four hours, they would need to be ready to execute a rescue operation that would either save Elena Martinez or potentially get several people killed.

## 9:30 AM - Building the Team

Carmen's phone had been ringing constantly since 8:30 AM. Word of the rescue operation was spreading through what Sarah was learning was an incredibly efficient informal communication network connecting everyone from fishermen to shopkeepers to retired military personnel living on the island.

"Miguel Rodríguez will bring his fishing boat for emergency evacuation if needed," Carmen reported, hanging up from her latest call. "Ana Torres has climbing equipment and rescue experience from her work with the mountain rescue service. And Carlos Vega-no relation to the Inspector-has night vision equipment and medical training."

Sarah was impressed by the rapid mobilization, but also concerned about operational security. "How many people know what we're actually planning?"

"The core team is seven people, including us. Everyone else thinks they're just on standby for a 'search and rescue operation' that might happen later today." Carmen's expression was serious. "These people can be trusted, Sarah. They've known Elena for years. She's not just a missing tourist to them-she's family."

Tomás returned from another equipment run, this time carrying what appeared to be professional rappelling gear. "My nephew runs adventure tours," he explained. "He's lending us ropes, harnesses, and helmets. If we need to get Elena out through a window or roof access, we'll be prepared."

The inn's main lounge was beginning to resemble a staging area for a major expedition. Maps, equipment, and communication devices were organized on every available surface. Sarah found herself thinking that Carmen would have made an excellent police sergeant-she had the organizational skills and natural leadership authority that made people want to follow her directions.

"There's one more thing," Carmen said hesitantly. "Miguel Torres called this morning. He's... concerned about Elena. And he's been drinking."

Sarah felt a chill of apprehension. "How concerned? And how drunk?"

"Concerned enough to want to help, drunk enough to be unpredictable. I told him to stay away, but..." Carmen shrugged. "You know how it is with men who feel responsible for protecting someone they care about."

This was exactly the kind of complication Sarah had been dreading. Well-meaning civilians with emotional involvement and impaired judgment could turn a carefully planned operation into a disaster.

## 10:30 AM - Final Preparations

The rescue team had assembled in Casa Vista Verde's dining room: Sarah, Carmen, Tomás, Ana Torres (the climbing expert), Carlos Vega (the medic), and two local fishermen who knew the coastal terrain better than anyone else on the island.

Sarah stood before the group, conscious that she was asking these people to risk their lives for someone most of them barely knew, based on a plan developed by an outsider with no official authority.

"I want everyone to understand what we're attempting," she began. "This is not a game, and it's not an adventure tour. Elena Martinez is being held by people who are armed and potentially desperate. If we do this wrong, people could get seriously hurt or killed."

The room was completely silent except for the distant sound of waves outside.

"That said," Sarah continued, "I believe we can get Elena out safely if we work together and follow the plan exactly. No improvisation, no individual heroics, no deviations unless I specifically authorize them. Is everyone clear on that?"

Nods around the room. Sarah could see the mixture of determination and nervousness in their faces, but no one seemed inclined to back out.

"Carlos, you're our medical backup and communication coordinator. You'll remain at the vehicles with the radios and be ready to call for evacuation or emergency services if needed."

Carlos nodded. At fifty-five, he was a retired army medic who had served in Afghanistan before returning to La Palma to run a small medical clinic.

"Ana, you're our technical specialist. If we need to access the building through unconventional means-windows, roof, whatever-you're in charge of rigging and safety."

Ana Torres was perhaps forty, lean and weathered from years of outdoor work, with the quiet competence Sarah associated with professional rescue personnel.

"Tomás, you're our guide and terrain expert. You know the approach routes and escape paths better than anyone else."

"The two boat crews will remain on standby at the harbor. If we need to evacuate Elena by sea-either for medical reasons or to avoid roadblocks-you'll be our lifeline."

Sarah spread out the detailed map they had been working with all morning. "The plan has three phases. Phase one is approach and positioning-we get into place while the kidnappers are still confident they've won. Phase two is distraction and entry-we create a diversion that draws the guards away from Elena's location. Phase three is extraction and escape-we get Elena out and everyone back to safety."

She looked around the room, meeting each person's eyes. "Questions?"

Ana Torres raised her hand. "What if Elena is injured and can't move quickly?"

"That's why we have medical backup and evacuation options. We adapt to circumstances, but we don't leave anyone behind."

Carlos spoke up: "What if the guards are better armed than we expect?"

"Then we abort the operation and wait for professional backup. I'm not asking anyone to get into a gunfight with desperate criminals."

## 11:00 AM - Unexpected Complications

Just as Sarah was about to dismiss the meeting and begin moving toward the target location, Carmen's phone rang. She glanced at the display and her expression immediately shifted to alarm.

"It's Miguel," she said, then answered the call. "Miguel, where are you?"

Even from across the room, Sarah could hear the slurred Spanish on the other end of the line. Miguel was clearly intoxicated and agitated, speaking rapidly in a voice loud enough to carry through the phone.

Carmen's responses became increasingly sharp and urgent. Finally, she hung up and looked at the group with obvious distress.

"He's at the plantation," she announced. "He drove there this morning to 'check on things himself' and now he's hiding in the old equipment shed, watching the building where Elena is being held."

Sarah felt her carefully constructed plan beginning to unravel. "How drunk is he?"

"Drunk enough to think he can rescue Elena single-handed, sober enough to know he's in over his head. He's calling because he wants backup, but he's also making noise that could alert the guards."

Tomás was already gathering his equipment. "We need to go now, before he does something stupid."

Sarah quickly recalculated their timeline. Instead of a methodical approach with careful positioning, they were now facing an emergency extraction complicated by an unpredictable drunk civilian who was already at the target location.

"Change of plans," she announced. "This is now a crisis response rather than a planned operation. Ana, Carlos, you're coming with us as backup. Boat crews, move to standby positions immediately. Carmen, call Ana Morales and tell her to accelerate her media campaign-we need the kidnappers distracted right now."

The team scattered with the disciplined efficiency of people accustomed to emergency situations. Within ten minutes, they were loaded into two vehicles and moving toward what Sarah hoped would be a successful rescue rather than a catastrophic confrontation.

## 11:30 AM - Race Against Time

As Carmen's SUV wound through the mountain roads toward Tazacorte, Sarah found herself running through contingency scenarios with increasing urgency. Miguel's presence had transformed their carefully planned operation into a crisis management situation where multiple variables were now beyond their control.

"How well do you know Miguel?" she asked Carmen, who was driving with the focused intensity of someone pushing a vehicle to its safe limits on unfamiliar roads.

"Well enough to know he's not stupid, just impulsive. If he's sober enough to call for help, he's sober enough to follow instructions. The question is whether we can reach him before he decides to take action on his own."

Sarah's radio crackled with Carlos's voice from the second vehicle: "Sarah, I'm monitoring emergency frequencies. No unusual police activity yet, which suggests the guards haven't noticed anything suspicious."

That was encouraging, but Sarah knew their window of opportunity was closing rapidly. Every minute Miguel remained at the plantation increased the risk of discovery, and every minute they delayed their approach reduced their options for a clean extraction.

"ETA?" Sarah asked.

"Twelve minutes to the access road, another eight minutes on foot to Miguel's position," Carmen replied. "Assuming he stays where he said he is."

Sarah checked her equipment one final time: radio, first aid kit, flashlight, rope. Not exactly the tactical gear she would have preferred for a hostage rescue operation, but it would have to suffice.

Through the SUV's windows, she could see La Palma's dramatic landscape rushing past-volcanic peaks, deep ravines, and steep hillsides covered in subtropical vegetation. It was beautiful terrain, but also unforgiving to anyone who made a serious mistake.

"There," Carmen said, pointing to a barely visible dirt track branching off from the main road. "That's our approach route."

As they parked and began unloading equipment, Sarah felt the familiar pre-action tension that had preceded every major operation during her police career. But this time, instead of professional backup and established protocols, she was depending on local knowledge and improvisational courage.

The next few hours would determine whether Elena Martinez went home safely or whether their rescue attempt became a tragedy that would haunt everyone involved for the rest of their lives.

Sarah checked her watch one final time: 11:45 AM. They had twelve hours and fifteen minutes remaining until the kidnappers' deadline.

Time to bring Elena home.
