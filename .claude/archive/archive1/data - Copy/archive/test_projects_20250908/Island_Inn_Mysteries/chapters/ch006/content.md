# Chapter 6: Unusual Tracks

The morning mist clung to the volcanic peaks as Sarah Mitchell stood at the trailhead where Elena's walking stick had been found three days earlier. This time, she wasn't alone. Beside her and Carmen stood Tomás Herrera, a distant cousin of Elena's and one of La Palma's most experienced mountain guides.

"You see differently when you know the land," Tomás was saying, his weathered hands gesturing toward the ground. "Tourists see a path. I see a story."

Sarah's feet, finally healing from her first mountain adventure, were properly equipped with professional hiking boots Carmen had insisted on buying for her. The morning air was crisp, carrying the scent of pine and volcanic earth, but there was an urgency in the atmosphere that had nothing to do with the weather.

"Show us what you see, Tomás," Sarah said, pulling out her phone to document everything.

Tomás knelt near the parking area, studying the ground with an intensity that reminded Sarah of crime scene technicians she'd worked with in London. "Here," he said finally. "These tracks-they don't belong."

Carmen and Sarah crouched beside him. At first, Sarah saw nothing unusual-just the typical chaos of tire marks from various vehicles. But Tomás traced a particular set with his finger.

"These are from a luxury SUV, probably a Mercedes or BMW. The tread pattern is distinctive-wide tires, expensive. But look at the depth of the impression and the way the gravel is scattered. This vehicle was heavily loaded."

"Search and rescue vehicles?" Sarah suggested.

"No." Tomás shook his head. "Those came after. These tracks are older, from before Elena disappeared. And see here?" He pointed to where the tracks ended. "They backed in, then left quickly-you can tell from the way the gravel sprayed."

Sarah photographed everything from multiple angles. "A luxury SUV at a hiking trail isn't unusual. Tourists rent them all the time."

"Sí, but not at 5 AM on a Tuesday," Tomás said. "I know because I was here that morning, preparing for a sunrise tour with German clients. I saw the vehicle leaving as I arrived-black Mercedes G-Class, tinted windows. I thought it strange at the time but didn't connect it until now."

Sarah's pulse quickened. "Did you see the license plate?"

"Rental plates. The kind from the airport agencies."

"That Tuesday morning," Carmen said slowly, "that's the day Elena disappeared."

They spent the next hour meticulously searching the area. Tomás's trained eye caught details Sarah would have missed-disturbed vegetation that didn't match normal foot traffic, a broken branch at an unusual height suggesting someone had grabbed it for support while carrying something heavy.

"There's more," Tomás said, leading them about fifty meters from the main trail. "This isn't on any tourist map, but locals know it. An old shepherd's shelter, abandoned for decades."

The shelter was little more than a stone foundation with partial walls, hidden by overgrown vegetation. But inside, the story continued. Fresh disturbances in the accumulated debris, footprints in the dust that hadn't been completely erased by wind.

"Someone was here recently," Sarah observed, photographing the scene. "Multiple people."

Carmen found something caught on a rough stone-a small piece of fabric, blue and white striped. "This looks like... Sarah, this is from Elena's favorite hiking shirt. Rosa showed me a photo of her wearing it the week before she disappeared."

Sarah carefully bagged the evidence. They were building a picture now-Elena had been taken from the trail, possibly held briefly in this shelter, then transported in the luxury SUV. But taken where? And by whom?

As they hiked back to the parking area, Carmen's phone rang. She answered in rapid Spanish, her expression growing increasingly serious.

"That was my cousin Javier," she said after hanging up. "He works at the land registry office. He says we need to talk, but not over the phone."

They met Javier at a small café in Los Llanos, choosing a corner table away from other patrons. Javier was a thin, nervous man who kept glancing around as if expecting to be watched.

"I shouldn't be telling you this," he began, accepting the coffee Carmen had ordered for him. "But when I heard about Tía Elena and what David was involved in... I started checking records."

"What kind of records?" Sarah asked.

"Land ownership, property transfers, development applications. Elena had been requesting copies of old deeds, some going back to the 1940s. She was particularly interested in coastal properties that had unclear ownership due to the civil war and its aftermath."

Carmen leaned forward. "Why would that matter now?"

"Because," Javier said, lowering his voice further, "if original ownership can't be clearly established, the land can be claimed by the state and sold for development. Elena discovered that someone has been systematically identifying these properties and quietly resolving ownership disputes-always in favor of development."

"David's shell companies," Sarah said.

"Not just David. This is bigger. Elena tracked connections to Las Palmas, even Madrid. She found a pattern-environmental protections being mysteriously lifted, permits appearing for previously protected areas, impact studies that contradict decades of scientific data."

"Did she take this to the authorities?" Sarah asked.

"She tried. But she told me she didn't know who to trust. That's why she was meeting with a lawyer from Las Palmas, someone outside the local system."

"Do you know this lawyer's name?"

"Ana Morales. She specializes in environmental law and indigenous land rights. Elena met with her three times in the month before she disappeared."

Sarah made note of the name. "Can you get us copies of the documents Elena was researching?"

Javier looked terrified. "If anyone finds out..."

"They won't," Carmen assured him. "And Javier, we're trying to find Elena. This might help."

After a long pause, Javier nodded. "I'll need a day to gather everything without raising suspicions. But there's something else. The black Mercedes you mentioned-a vehicle matching that description was rented from the airport three days before Elena disappeared. The rental agreement was in the name of a German company, Hamburg Development Group."

Sarah felt pieces clicking into place. Hamburg Development Group-the same investors Luis from the environmental organization had mentioned. They weren't just involved in the development schemes; they'd apparently decided to remove Elena when she became too much of a threat.

Back at Casa Vista Verde, the inn was bustling with evening activity. The search teams had returned for the day, and volunteers were sharing information over Carmen's homemade tapas and local wine. The atmosphere was simultaneously warm and tense-a community united in purpose but frustrated by the lack of progress.

Sarah set up her laptop in a quiet corner and began researching Hamburg Development Group. What she found made her stomach turn. The company was a subsidiary of a larger conglomerate with interests in resort development across the Mediterranean. They specialized in acquiring "underutilized" coastal properties and turning them into luxury resorts. Their methods had been questioned before-in Greece, in Croatia-but never proven illegal.

"Sarah," Carmen appeared with a phone. "Ana Morales is on the line. The lawyer from Las Palmas."

Sarah took the phone, moving to the terrace for privacy. "Ms. Morales? This is Sarah Mitchell."

"Ms. Mitchell, I heard about David Herrera's arrest. Has there been any word about Elena?"

"Not yet. But we're learning more about what she was investigating. Can you tell me what she brought to you?"

There was a pause. "Elena had built an extensive case. She'd identified seventeen properties across La Palma where ownership had been deliberately obscured to facilitate development. She had evidence of bribery, document forgery, and environmental fraud. We were preparing to file a comprehensive challenge that would have frozen all development on the island pending investigation."

"When was this supposed to be filed?"

"Next week. Elena wanted to ensure everything was perfect. She knew she'd only get one chance."

"Ms. Morales, do you have copies of Elena's evidence?"

"Some, but not all. Elena was paranoid about security-rightly, it seems. She kept the most damaging evidence hidden, said she'd bring it when we filed. She mentioned something about 'where the old recipes are kept,' but I never understood what that meant."

Sarah's mind raced. Rosa had mentioned the same thing-Elena's hiding place connected to recipes. "Ms. Morales, if Elena's evidence could stop developments worth millions of euros..."

"Try hundreds of millions," Ana corrected. "The coastal properties alone are valued at over 300 million euros once developed. The people behind this aren't just criminals-they're powerful, connected, and desperate."

After ending the call, Sarah found Inspector Vega in the dining room, coordinating with his team. She pulled him aside and shared what they'd discovered.

"A kidnapping," he said grimly. "This changes our entire approach. If Elena's been taken to use as leverage against filing those documents..."

"They might still be holding her alive," Sarah finished. "As insurance."

"I'll get a warrant for the rental car records, trace the Mercedes. But Sarah, if Hamburg Development Group is involved, they have resources we can't match. Private planes, boats, safe houses..."

Sarah looked around the room at the volunteers-locals who'd given up their time to search for Elena, tourists who'd extended their vacations to help, Carmen's extended family network providing information and support.

"They have resources," Sarah agreed. "But we have something they don't-a community that won't give up."

As if to underscore her point, Tomás appeared in the doorway, slightly out of breath. "I've been thinking about those tire tracks," he said. "The direction they were headed when leaving-there's only one logical destination if you're not going back to town."

"Where?"

"The old banana plantation near Tazacorte. It's been abandoned for years, but it has storage buildings, road access, and it's isolated. If I wanted to hide someone on this island, that's where I'd go."

Inspector Vega was already reaching for his radio, but Sarah caught his arm. "If we go in with sirens and helicopters, they might panic, hurt Elena."

"What do you suggest?"

"Surveillance first. Confirm she's there. Then we plan a careful approach."

Vega nodded slowly. "You're thinking like a detective, not an innkeeper."

"Old habits," Sarah said with a grim smile.

As plans formed around them, Carmen appeared with Sarah's phone. "Someone's calling from a blocked number."

Sarah answered cautiously. "Hello?"

The voice was accented, cultured, cold. "Ms. Mitchell. You've been very busy these past few days."

"Who is this?"

"Someone with a proposition. Elena Herrera is alive and well. She'll remain so if you and your friends stop interfering with legitimate business operations."

Sarah motioned frantically for Vega to trace the call. "What do you want?"

"The documents Elena compiled must not be filed. The lawyer in Las Palmas must withdraw. The investigation must end. In return, Elena will be found safe within 48 hours."

"How do we know she's alive?"

There was a rustling, then Elena's voice, weak but unmistakable: "Sarah? Don't trust-"

The line cut to the cold voice again. "Satisfied? You have 24 hours to convince the authorities to close the investigation. If our developments are challenged in court, Elena Herrera disappears permanently."

The line went dead.

The room had gone silent, everyone staring at Sarah. She looked at Inspector Vega, who shook his head-not enough time to trace.

"Well," Sarah said, setting down the phone with a steady hand despite her racing heart. "Now we know for certain. Elena is alive, and we have 24 hours to find her."

"The plantation Tomás mentioned," Carmen said urgently. "It has to be."

"It's our best lead," Vega agreed. "I'll organize surveillance immediately."

As the room erupted into activity-plans being made, calls being placed, equipment being gathered-Sarah stood still for a moment, thinking. The kidnappers had made a crucial mistake. They'd confirmed Elena was alive and that they were desperate enough to negotiate. That meant they were vulnerable.

"Carmen," she said quietly. "We need to talk to Ana Morales again. If we can make them think we're complying while actually preparing to move..."

Carmen's eyes lit up with understanding. "A deception."

"Elena tried to tell us something-'don't trust.' I think she was warning us they won't keep their word."

"So we won't keep ours either."

Sarah nodded, looking out at the darkening sky over the Atlantic. Somewhere on this island, Elena Herrera was being held against her will by people who thought money and power could override justice and community.

They were about to learn how wrong they were.

Tomorrow would bring the rescue attempt. Tonight, they would plan every detail. And Casa Vista Verde, the small inn that Sarah had bought to escape her past, would serve as the command center for bringing Elena home.

The tracks had been unusual indeed-but they'd led exactly where Sarah needed to go.
