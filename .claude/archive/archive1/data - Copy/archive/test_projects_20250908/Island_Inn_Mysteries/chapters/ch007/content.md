# Chapter 7: The Rescue Plan

The war room that had once been Casa Vista Verde's dining room hummed with controlled chaos at 10:00 PM. Sarah Mitchell stood before a large map of La Palma's western coast, red circles marking the abandoned banana plantation near Tazacorte. Around her, a carefully selected team prepared for what could either be a rescue or a tragedy.

"We have less than twenty hours," Sarah said, her voice cutting through the murmur of conversations. "The kidnappers expect compliance by tomorrow evening. We need to move before then."

Inspector Vega studied aerial photographs spread across the table. "The plantation covers twelve hectares. Multiple buildings, overgrown access roads. If they have Elena there, finding the exact location won't be simple."

"Which is why we scout first," Tomás interjected. The mountain guide had changed into dark clothing, his weathered face set with determination. "I know trails that approach from the north-old paths the banana workers used before the plantation failed. We can get close without using the main roads."

Carmen entered with a laptop, setting it on a cleared corner of the table. "Ana Morales is ready to video call from Las Palmas."

The lawyer's face appeared on screen, her expression grave. "I've prepared a press statement announcing the temporary suspension of all legal challenges to development projects on La Palma. It's carefully worded-legally meaningless but convincing to anyone not versed in environmental law."

"Will they believe it?" Sarah asked.

"They'll want to believe it," Ana replied. "Greed makes people careless. The statement will go live at 8 AM tomorrow, giving them the impression they've won."

"Meanwhile," Inspector Vega added, "I'll make a show of calling off the official search. My officers will be very visible returning to normal duties."

Sarah nodded, but her mind was already moving ahead. Twenty years of police work had taught her that the best plans were flexible ones. "We need contingencies. What if Elena's not at the plantation? What if there are more guards than expected?"

"We adapt," Carmen said simply. "This is our island. We know every path, every hiding place. They don't."

Tomás spread a hand-drawn map beside the official ones. "My grandfather worked that plantation in the 1960s. These buildings here"-he pointed to structures not shown on modern maps-"old storage sheds, mostly collapsed now. Good cover for approach."

Sarah studied the layout, her detective instincts cataloging angles, distances, potential escape routes. "We need eyes on the ground tonight. Confirm Elena's there before we commit."

"I'll go," Tomás volunteered. "Take two others who know the land."

"I'm coming with you," Sarah said.

Carmen grabbed her arm. "Sarah, no. Your feet are barely healed. You can't-"

"I need to see it myself," Sarah interrupted gently. "I need to understand the layout, the guard patterns. Things I can't assess from photos."

There was a long pause before Carmen released her arm. "Then I'm coming too."

"No," Sarah said firmly. "I need you here, coordinating. If something goes wrong, you're the only one who can hold this together."

Before Carmen could protest, Sarah's phone buzzed. Unknown number.

She answered on speaker. "Mitchell."

"Enjoying your evening planning session?" The cold voice from earlier sent chills through the room. "We're watching, Ms. Mitchell. Any attempt at rescue will result in Elena's immediate death."

Sarah kept her voice steady. "We're discussing how to meet your demands. The lawyer needs time to file the proper paperwork."

"You have until 6 PM tomorrow. Not a minute longer."

The line went dead.

"They're bluffing," Inspector Vega said after a moment. "If they could see us, they'd know exactly what we're planning."

"Or they have someone on the inside," Sarah said quietly, looking around the room. She trusted everyone here, but trust had to be balanced with caution. "We proceed, but carefully. Tomás, we leave at 3 AM. Until then, everyone acts normally."

The next four hours crawled by. Sarah tried to rest but found herself poring over maps and photos, memorizing every detail. At 2:45 AM, she met Tomás and two local fishermen, brothers named Carlos and José, at the inn's back entrance.

They drove in silence, taking back roads Sarah hadn't known existed. Tomás parked the vehicle two kilometers from the plantation, hidden among dense vegetation.

"From here, we walk," he whispered.

The path was barely visible even in the moonlight, but Tomás moved with absolute confidence. Sarah followed, grateful for the hiking boots Carmen had bought her, her feet protesting but functional. The brothers brought up the rear, silent as shadows.

The abandoned plantation appeared gradually through the subtropical foliage-ghostly structures silvered by moonlight, overtaken by nature's reclamation. Tomás led them to a ridge overlooking the complex.

"There," he pointed. 

Through binoculars, Sarah could see two vehicles parked near a large warehouse-the black Mercedes G-Class from the mountain trail and another SUV, also with rental plates. A faint light glowed in one window.

They waited, watching. At 4:15 AM, a figure emerged from the warehouse, lit a cigarette. Guard number one. Twenty minutes later, another man walked the perimeter. Guard number two.

"Lazy surveillance," Sarah murmured. "They're confident we won't find them."

"Or they want us to think that," Carlos suggested.

They continued observing. At 5:30 AM, as dawn began to lighten the eastern sky, Sarah saw something that made her heart race. A third figure appeared at the lit window-smaller, moving differently. Through the binoculars, she could just make out grey hair, a familiar profile.

"Elena," she breathed.

She was alive, apparently unharmed, but clearly captive. The window had bars.

"Three guards so far," Tomás noted. "Could be more inside."

Sarah studied the building's layout. "There-see that loading dock on the east side? It's been boarded up, but the boards are weathered, loose. Secondary entrance."

"The main road enters from the south," José added. "But there's an old service road from the west, overgrown but passable on foot."

They watched until 6:00 AM, noting guard rotations, blind spots, potential approach routes. Sarah's detective mind cataloged everything, building a three-dimensional model of the site in her head.

The return journey seemed longer, urgency and exhaustion weighing on them. They arrived at Casa Vista Verde to find Carmen coordinating breakfast for two dozen volunteers who'd assembled in their absence.

"Well?" Carmen asked anxiously.

"She's there. Three guards minimum, possibly more. Building's old but solid. We can do this, but we need to be smart about it."

Inspector Vega arrived at 7:30 AM. "I'm about to make a very public show of standing down the search. The mayor's agreed to express 'disappointment but understanding' about resource allocation."

At 8:00 AM sharp, Ana Morales's statement hit the news websites and social media. Within minutes, Sarah's phone rang.

"Very good, Ms. Mitchell," the cold voice said. "We're pleased to see cooperation. Elena will be released once we've confirmed the legal challenges are truly withdrawn."

"When?"

"Soon. Keep your phone on."

After the call, Sarah gathered the core team. "They're buying it, but they won't release her. Elena tried to warn us-'don't trust.' We proceed with the rescue."

The morning progressed with careful preparation. Volunteers with relevant skills were quietly briefed-rock climbers with rope expertise, fishermen familiar with night navigation, farmers who knew every path in the area. Equipment was gathered: climbing gear, first aid supplies, communications devices.

At 10:00 AM, Sarah noticed something crucial while reviewing the surveillance notes. "The guard rotation-there's a gap. When they change shifts around 2 PM, there's about five minutes when the outgoing guard leaves before the replacement takes position."

"Our window," Inspector Vega agreed.

"We'll need a distraction," Carmen said. "Something to draw their attention to the main entrance while a team enters from the east."

"I can arrange for a 'lost tourist' to drive up asking for directions," Vega suggested. "Loud, confused, insistent."

Sarah was about to respond when commotion erupted in the kitchen. Miguel Herrera stumbled in, clearly drunk despite the early hour, Maria trailing behind him trying to restrain him.

"Where is she?" Miguel shouted. "Where's David? I know he's behind this! I'll kill him!"

Several volunteers tried to calm him, but Miguel pushed past them, heading for the door. "I'm going to find my grandmother myself!"

Sarah moved quickly, blocking his path. "Miguel, stop. You'll put Elena in danger."

"You don't understand!" His eyes were wild, desperate. "This is my fault. The debts, the pressure-David used me to get to her. I have to fix this!"

"Then help us," Sarah said firmly. "But charging in drunk will only get her killed."

Miguel collapsed into a chair, sobbing. Maria wrapped her arms around him. "He's been like this since David's arrest. The guilt is eating him alive."

Carmen knelt beside them. "Miguel, we know where Elena is. We're going to get her back. But we need you to stay here, stay quiet."

"You know where she is?" Hope flickered in his bloodshot eyes.

Sarah made a quick decision. "Yes. And we're going to bring her home. But if word gets out, if the kidnappers suspect anything, they'll move her or worse. Can you keep this secret?"

Miguel nodded frantically. "I'll do anything. Just bring her back."

Inspector Vega pulled Sarah aside. "This complicates things. If he talks to anyone..."

"He won't," Maria said firmly. "I'll keep him here, keep him quiet. You have my word."

Sarah looked at the assembled team-professional law enforcement, local volunteers, family members united in purpose. It wasn't a typical police operation, but then nothing about La Palma had been typical since she'd arrived.

"We go at 2 PM," she announced. "Team One creates the distraction. Team Two enters from the east. Team Three provides medical support and extraction. Everyone knows their role?"

Nods all around.

Carmen pulled Sarah aside. "You're planning to go in with Team Two, aren't you?"

"I have to. I know the building layout best."

"Then I'm going with you."

"Carmen-"

"No arguments. Elena took care of me when my parents died. I won't stand by while others risk everything for her."

Sarah saw the determination in Carmen's eyes and knew better than to argue. "Fine. But you follow my lead exactly."

At 11:45 AM, as final preparations were being made, Sarah stood on the terrace looking toward Tazacorte. Somewhere in that abandoned plantation, Elena Herrera was waiting, probably unaware that her entire community was mobilizing to save her.

The kidnappers had made a crucial error. They'd assumed that money and threats would be enough, that a small island community could be intimidated into submission. They hadn't counted on the bonds that connected these people, the fierce loyalty to one of their own.

"Sarah?" Carmen appeared beside her. "Inspector Vega's tourist volunteer just arrived. Former theater actor from Berlin, here on vacation. He's perfect-loud, entitled, impossible to ignore."

Sarah smiled grimly. "Then we're ready."

She looked at her phone: 11:47 AM. In two hours and thirteen minutes, they would either rescue Elena or lose her forever. There would be no second chances.

"Carmen," she said quietly, "whatever happens, thank you. For trusting me, for letting me be part of this."

Carmen squeezed her hand. "You're not part of this, Sarah. You're leading it. And that's exactly what Elena would want-someone who sees what others miss, who brings different skills to our island ways."

They stood together for a moment, two unlikely partners united by crisis and purpose. Then Sarah straightened, the detective in her taking control.

"Let's go bring Elena home."

The rescue plan was set. The teams were ready. The clock was ticking.

In just over two hours, everything would change.
