# Chapter 4: Family Secrets

The evening breeze carried the scent of jasmine through the open windows of Casa Vista Verde as Sarah Mitchell settled into one of the worn leather chairs in the sitting room. Her feet, still tender from the day's mountain expedition, were elevated on a cushioned ottoman, the blisters on her heels throbbing with each heartbeat. Despite the physical exhaustion that seemed to permeate every muscle in her body, her mind remained restlessly active, turning over the day's discoveries like stones in a tumbler.

Elena's walking stick, abandoned on that remote mountain path. The disturbing evidence of Klaus Weber's presence on the island. The way Carmen's hand had trembled slightly as she'd photographed the poacher's trap. All of it swirled together in Sarah's thoughts, forming a picture she couldn't quite bring into focus.

Carmen emerged from the kitchen carrying a tray laden with two steaming cups of manzanilla tea and a small plate of *magdalenas*. The Spanish woman moved with a quiet grace that belied the tension Sarah could see in the set of her shoulders.

"You should eat something," Carmen said, settling into the chair across from Sarah. "You've had nothing since this morning except that terrible energy bar."

Sarah accepted the tea gratefully, inhaling the chamomile-scented steam. "I keep thinking about what we found up there. That trap... it was meant for something larger than a rabbit, wasn't it?"

Carmen's dark eyes met hers over the rim of her cup. "Sí, much larger. The spacing between the jaws, the weight of the spring mechanism... it was designed for a predator. Perhaps a fox or even a wild boar, though we have few of those left on La Palma."

"Or for someone who might stumble into it accidentally while investigating," Sarah said quietly.

The implication hung in the air between them like smoke. Carmen set down her cup with careful precision, her fingers lingering on the handle.

"Sarah, there is something you should know about Elena. She was not simply wandering the mountains for her health. She had been... how do you say... monitoring the restricted areas for months. Taking photographs, making notes. She believed someone was violating the protected status of the breeding grounds."

This revelation shouldn't have surprised Sarah, but it sent a chill through her nonetheless. Elena Vasquez, the retired schoolteacher with her sensible shoes and her gentle manner, had been conducting her own investigation into the very activities that may have led to her disappearance.

"Did she share her suspicions with anyone? Inspector Vega? The park authorities?"

Carmen shook her head. "Elena was careful, methodical. She wanted proof before making accusations. She said the island's ecosystem was too fragile for half-measures and speculation."

Sarah shifted in her chair, trying to find a position that didn't aggravate her sore muscles. Through the window, she could see lights beginning to twinkle in the houses scattered across the hillside below. Normal people living normal lives, while somewhere out there, a woman who had dedicated herself to protecting her island's natural heritage might be fighting for her survival.

"Carmen," Sarah said, turning back to her hostess, "would it be terribly presumptuous of me to offer to help deliver the evening meal to the Herrera family? I know you usually handle it yourself, but given everything that's happened..."

Carmen's eyebrows lifted in surprise. "You would do that? But you are exhausted, and your feet..."

"I need to do something. Sitting here thinking in circles isn't helping anyone." Sarah managed a wry smile. "Besides, you've done so much for me today. The least I can do is help with your regular duties."

The truth was more complex than Sarah was ready to articulate. Something about Miguel Herrera's behavior at the search briefing had struck her as odd. Not his grief - that had seemed genuine enough - but an underlying nervousness that went beyond concern for Elena. In her years as a journalist, Sarah had developed an instinct for recognizing when people were carrying secrets that weighed heavier than their stated concerns.

Carmen considered the offer for a long moment, then nodded slowly. "Perhaps that would be good. The family has been under such strain, and sometimes a fresh perspective can bring comfort. Or clarity."

An hour later, Sarah found herself walking carefully along the cobblestone path that led to the Herrera family home, carrying a large wicker basket that smelled of saffron and roasted garlic. Carmen had insisted on wrapping Sarah's feet in soft bandages before they left, and had provided a pair of comfortable walking shoes that fit remarkably well.

The Herrera house sat on a slight rise above the village center, its traditional Canarian architecture enhanced by modern renovations that spoke of quiet prosperity. Wooden balconies painted in cheerful blue adorned the upper floor, and the front garden was meticulously maintained with native plants and flowering shrubs. As Sarah approached the front door, she could hear voices from within - multiple conversations overlapping in the way that only family gatherings could produce.

Before she could knock, the door swung open to reveal Maria Herrera, Miguel's wife. Sarah had met her briefly at the search briefing, but now she had a chance to observe the woman more closely. Maria was perhaps fifty-five, with prematurely gray hair pulled back in a neat bun and worry lines etched deeply around her dark eyes. She wore a simple black dress that suggested mourning, though Elena had not been confirmed dead.

"Señora Mitchell," Maria said, her English heavily accented but clear. "Carmen told me you might come. Please, enter."

The interior of the house embraced Sarah with warmth and the complex aromas of a traditional Spanish dinner. The main room opened directly into a dining area where a long wooden table was set for what appeared to be eight people. Sarah could see through an archway into the kitchen, where several women moved efficiently between stove and counter, their conversation a rapid patter of Spanish punctuated by the clatter of pans and the hiss of frying oil.

Miguel Herrera emerged from what Sarah assumed was a study or office, his face lighting up with genuine pleasure at seeing her.

"Ah, our English guest! How kind of you to bring our meal. How are you feeling after your mountain adventure? Carmen told us you went searching for Elena."

"A bit sore," Sarah admitted, setting the basket on a side table. "But glad we could help with the search effort. I only wish we'd found more encouraging signs."

Miguel's expression grew somber. "Sí, the walking stick... it troubles me greatly. Elena was never careless with her belongings. Everything had its place, its purpose."

From the kitchen came a sharp burst of laughter, followed by what sounded like a good-natured argument about seasoning. The normalcy of it struck Sarah as both comforting and surreal given the circumstances.

"You have a lovely family gathering," Sarah observed.

"Not all family," Miguel said, and Sarah caught a note of something - tension? irritation? - in his voice. "My nephew David arrived this afternoon from Tenerife. The family felt it was important for him to be here during... this difficult time."

As if summoned by the mention of his name, a man appeared in the archway leading from the kitchen. David Herrera was perhaps forty, tall and lean with the kind of commanding presence that seemed to fill a room without effort. His dark hair was immaculately styled, and he wore an expensive-looking shirt that was somehow still crisp despite the humidity of the kitchen. When he smiled at Sarah, she noticed that the expression didn't quite reach his eyes.

"You must be our English investigator," he said, extending a hand. His grip was firm to the point of being aggressive. "David Herrera. I understand you've been helping with the search for Tía Elena."

"Sarah Mitchell. I'm just a guest who happened to be available when Carmen organized the search efforts."

"Ah, but you have experience in these matters, no? Carmen mentioned you were a journalist in London. Investigative work?"

Sarah felt a flicker of unease at how quickly David had gathered information about her background. "Some investigative pieces, yes. Though I'm hardly qualified for search and rescue operations."

"Still, fresh eyes can sometimes see what familiarity has missed," David said. "Though I must say, I worry that everyone is perhaps looking too hard for dramatic explanations. Elena is seventy-three years old. She has been walking these mountains for decades, yes, but age makes even familiar paths treacherous. Sometimes the simplest explanation is the correct one."

The casual dismissal in his tone sparked something protective in Sarah's chest. "The walking stick suggests she encountered some kind of difficulty. And the location where we found it..."

"Could mean many things," David interrupted smoothly. "She might have dropped it while resting, forgot to retrieve it. Or perhaps she slipped, fell, became disoriented. The mind at her age... well, we must be realistic about these possibilities."

Miguel shifted uncomfortably beside his nephew. "David, Elena's mind is sharp as ever. She would not simply become confused and wander off."

"Of course not intentionally," David said, his tone taking on a patronizing edge that made Sarah's teeth set. "But accidents happen, Tío. Sometimes we must accept difficult truths rather than looking for conspiracies where none exist."

Before anyone could respond, Maria called from the dining area. "¡A la mesa! Dinner is ready!"

The transition from the tense conversation to the warm chaos of a family dinner was jarring. Sarah found herself seated between Carmen, who had arrived while they were talking, and one of Miguel's cousins, a cheerful woman named Rosa who insisted on translating every dish as it was passed around the table.

"This is *ropa vieja*," Rosa explained, ladling a fragrant stew onto Sarah's plate. "The name means 'old clothes' but don't worry - it's beef with chickpeas and vegetables. Very traditional."

The food was exceptional, rich with flavors that spoke of recipes passed down through generations. Sarah noticed, however, that despite the apparent conviviality, there was an undercurrent of tension that seemed to flow around David like water around a stone. Family members deferred to him in subtle ways - asking his opinion on minor matters, adjusting their conversation when he turned his attention their way.

Sarah was beginning to understand that David Herrera was not simply Miguel's nephew but someone who held considerable influence within the family structure. She wondered what role he played in the family's various business interests, and why his arrival had seemed to shift the entire dynamic of the gathering.

"Sarah," David said, raising his wine glass toward her, "tell us about your impressions of our island. It must be quite different from London."

"It's beautiful," Sarah replied honestly. "The landscape, the culture, the warmth of the people. I feel very fortunate to be here, though obviously I wish the circumstances were different."

"Circumstances?"

"Elena's disappearance. It's cast a shadow over what should have been a peaceful visit."

David nodded thoughtfully. "Yes, it's tragic. But you mustn't let it color your entire experience of La Palma. These things... they resolve themselves, one way or another. Life continues."

There was something in his phrasing that struck Sarah as oddly callous, but before she could respond, she became aware of a heated conversation taking place at the other end of the table. Two of Miguel's brothers were speaking in rapid Spanish, their voices growing increasingly animated. Sarah caught fragments - something about contracts, deadlines, and money.

Carmen, seated beside her, had gone very still, her attention focused on the argument. Sarah saw her exchange a meaningful glance with Maria, who had started to rise from her seat, clearly intending to intervene.

But David was faster. He stood smoothly, his wine glass still in hand, and said something in Spanish that was too quiet for Sarah to catch but caused an immediate silence to fall over the table. The two arguing men looked down at their plates, their faces flushed with what Sarah assumed was embarrassment.

"Forgive us," David said, turning to Sarah with an apologetic smile. "Family business sometimes intrudes on social occasions. It's nothing that can't be resolved with patience and clear thinking."

The remainder of the meal passed in carefully polite conversation, but Sarah remained acutely aware of the undercurrents flowing beneath the surface. She noticed that Maria barely touched her food, that Miguel kept glancing at his nephew with an expression she couldn't quite interpret, and that several family members excused themselves early, claiming fatigue or other obligations.

As the evening wound down, Sarah helped Carmen clear the dishes, carrying them through to the kitchen where Maria was already beginning the washing up. The older woman looked grateful for the assistance, but Sarah could see the strain in the tight line of her shoulders.

"Mrs. Herrera," Sarah said quietly as she rinsed plates, "if there's anything I can do to help during this difficult time, please don't hesitate to ask. I know how hard it must be to maintain normal routines when someone you care about is missing."

Maria's hands stilled in the soapy water. For a moment, Sarah thought she might speak, might unburden herself of whatever worry was clearly weighing on her. Instead, she glanced toward the doorway where the sound of male voices could be heard, then shook her head slightly.

"You are very kind, señora. But some burdens must be carried by family alone."

Carmen appeared at Sarah's elbow, carrying the last of the serving dishes. "We should let the family have their privacy," she said, but there was something in her tone that suggested urgency rather than mere politeness.

As they prepared to leave, David appeared in the kitchen doorway. "Señora Mitchell, I hope you won't let tonight's family tensions give you the wrong impression. We're all under strain with Elena missing, and sometimes old disagreements surface when emotions are high."

"Of course," Sarah replied. "Every family has its complexities."

"Precisely. And sometimes those complexities are best resolved without outside intervention, no matter how well-intentioned." His smile was warm, but his eyes remained cold. "I'm sure a woman of your experience understands the wisdom of allowing families to handle their private matters privately."

The warning was subtle but unmistakable. Sarah kept her own expression neutral as she nodded. "Absolutely. I wouldn't dream of intruding where I wasn't welcome."

They walked back to Casa Vista Verde in relative silence, each woman lost in her own thoughts. The night air was cool and fragrant with the scent of night-blooming cereus, and the sounds of the village settling into evening quiet - dogs barking, television programs drifting through open windows, the distant sound of someone playing guitar - created a peaceful backdrop that contrasted sharply with the tension they'd left behind.

It wasn't until they were back in Carmen's sitting room, the door securely closed behind them, that Carmen finally spoke.

"Maria pulled me aside while you were helping with the dishes," she said without preamble. "Miguel has gambling debts. Significant ones. She's terrified that David knows, or will discover them."

Sarah set down the empty basket she'd been carrying and turned to face Carmen fully. "How significant?"

"Enough to potentially lose the restaurant. The house. Everything they've built together."

The pieces of the evening's strange dynamics began to fall into place. Miguel's nervousness, Maria's haunted expression, the deference shown to David despite his status as nephew rather than elder.

"And David?"

"He controls much of the family's business interests. If he wanted to call in debts, or withdraw support..." Carmen spread her hands helplessly. "The family would be ruined."

Sarah sank into her chair, her mind racing. "The argument at dinner - the one about contracts and deadlines. That was about Miguel's situation?"

"I believe so. Though they were speaking too quickly for me to catch all the details. But there was mention of 'the old contract' - something that apparently gives David significant power over family business decisions."

"What kind of old contract?"

"I don't know. But from the tone of the conversation, it's something that was established years ago, probably when David was younger and the family business was expanding. Perhaps some kind of partnership agreement or loan arrangement that has given him leverage he didn't originally intend to use."

Sarah thought about David's smooth confidence, the way other family members had deferred to his judgment, his casual dismissal of Elena's disappearance as merely the confused wandering of an elderly woman.

"Carmen, is there any connection between Elena and the Herrera family business interests? Any reason David might want her... out of the way?"

Carmen was quiet for a long moment, staring into her teacup as if it might hold answers. "Elena has always been protective of the island's natural heritage. If she had discovered evidence of illegal activities in the protected areas - poaching, as we suspected today - she would have pursued it regardless of who was involved."

"Even if it implicated a prominent local family?"

"Especially then. Elena believes that those who have more should be held to higher standards, not lower ones."

Sarah felt a chill that had nothing to do with the evening breeze. "You think there might be a connection between the Herrera family and the poaching activities Elena was investigating?"

"I think," Carmen said carefully, "that we have found more questions than answers today. And I think David Herrera's arrival has changed something in the family dynamic that goes beyond concern for Elena's welfare."

They sat in thoughtful silence, each processing the implications of the evening's revelations. Outside, the village continued its peaceful evening routine, but inside Casa Vista Verde, two women contemplated the possibility that Elena Vasquez's disappearance might be more than a simple hiking accident.

Sarah's feet still ached, her muscles still protested every movement, but her mind was fully alert now, turning over possibilities like a detective examining evidence. The journalist in her recognized the familiar pattern - the surface story that seemed straightforward, the undercurrents that suggested complexity, the people whose behavior didn't quite match their stated concerns.

"What do we do now?" she asked finally.

Carmen met her eyes. "We continue looking for Elena. But we also start asking different questions. About the poaching, about the family business, about why David Herrera felt it was so important to return from Tenerife and take control of the situation."

"And we do it carefully," Sarah added. "Because if there is a connection, if someone did harm Elena to protect their illegal activities, then they won't hesitate to harm anyone else who gets too close to the truth."

Carmen nodded grimly. "Welcome to La Palma, Sarah Mitchell. I hope you are prepared for more than a peaceful writing retreat."

Sarah looked out at the twinkling lights of the village below, thinking about Elena Vasquez somewhere out there in the darkness, and about the complex web of family loyalty, business interests, and environmental crime that seemed to be tightening around them all.

"I'm beginning to think," she said quietly, "that peaceful was never really an option."

As the night deepened around Casa Vista Verde, the two women began to plan their next moves, unaware that in the Herrera family home across the village, David Herrera was making plans of his own - plans that would ensure certain secrets remained buried, regardless of the cost.
