# Chapter 1: New Beginnings

## Scene 1: Kitchen Disaster (6:30 AM)

The ancient gas stove hissed like an angry cat as Sarah Mitchell fumbled with the controls, her hands still shaking slightly from the morning's caffeine withdrawal. Three months on La Palma, and she still couldn't master the temperamental beast that dominated the Casa Vista Verde kitchen.

"Come on, you stubborn thing," she muttered, clicking the igniter for the fourth time. The blue flame finally caught, casting dancing shadows across the terracotta tiles. "Right, eggs. How hard can it be?"

She'd managed perfectly decent breakfasts for twenty-five years of London living, but this kitchen seemed designed to humble her at every turn. The wooden spoons were carved from some local wood she couldn't identify, the pans were heavier than her old detective badge, and every utensil seemed to occupy precisely the wrong drawer.

The first egg cracked against the pan's rim with more force than intended, shell fragments scattering like confetti into the sizzling oil. "Brilliant, Sarah. Just brilliant." She picked at the larger pieces with a knife tip, muttering the same words her old sergeant used to say: "Attention to detail separates the professionals from the amateurs."

*Perhaps retirement was premature,* she thought, watching the egg whites bubble and crisp at the edges. *If I can't handle breakfast, what hope do I have running a bed and breakfast?*

The kitchen door swung open, bringing with it the sound of German voices from the dining terrace-her guests, the Muellers, already awake and likely expecting their "proper Continental breakfast" as specified in their booking email. Sarah had learned enough German during her Metropolitan Police days to catch the gist of their early morning complaints: the shower water pressure, the roosters next door, the "provincial" Wi-Fi signal.

She cracked the second egg more carefully, pleased when it slid intact into the pan. Small victories, she reminded herself. Detective work had taught her to appreciate incremental progress, even when the case-or in this instance, the breakfast service-seemed to be going sideways.

The toast popped up, perfectly golden. "Finally, something cooperates." She was reaching for the butter when the oil in the pan began to smoke, the eggs transforming from golden to concerningly brown. "No, no, no-"

The smoke detector chose that moment to voice its electronic displeasure, a piercing wail that sent her scrambling for the off button while juggling the spatula. Through the kitchen window, she caught sight of her neighbor's chickens scattering in apparent sympathy with the alarm.

"Mrs. Mitchell?" a voice called from outside. "¿Está todo bien? Is everything okay?"

Sarah's shoulders sagged with relief and embarrassment in equal measure. Carmen Elena Rodriguez-the young woman who'd helped her navigate the property purchase and promised to teach her the "secrets of Canarian hospitality"-stood at the kitchen's exterior door, her dark eyes bright with concern and barely concealed amusement.

"Everything's under control," Sarah called back, waving smoke away from the detector. "Just... adjusting to the local cooking methods."

Carmen's laughter was warm and musical. "May I come in? I brought some fresh platanos from my grandmother's tree, and I think perhaps you could use a hand with breakfast, sí?"

*Pride goeth before the fall,* Sarah's mother used to say. And right now, with smoke still curling from the pan and German complaints growing louder on the terrace, pride seemed like a luxury she couldn't afford.

## Scene 2: Carmen's Arrival (6:45 AM)

Carmen stepped into the kitchen with the confidence of someone who belonged there, taking in the smoking pan and scattered eggshells with a quick, professional assessment. She was twenty-eight, Sarah had learned during their previous meetings, but moved with the assured competence of someone much older.

"Ah, I see you're making friends with Manuela," Carmen said, patting the stove's side fondly.

"Manuela?"

"My grandmother's name for this stove. She says all the good cooks on the island have one like her-temperamental but reliable, if you know how to speak her language." Carmen turned off the heat and moved the pan from the burner with practiced ease. "She doesn't like to be rushed in the morning. Like most of us Canarian women."

Sarah watched, fascinated, as Carmen scraped the ruined eggs into the compost bin she'd apparently overlooked in her frantic cleanup attempts. "I'm afraid I'm still learning the local customs. In London, breakfast was rather more... predictable."

"London breakfast is good for London weather," Carmen replied, already cracking fresh eggs into the cleaned pan. "But here, the morning is different. More patient, you know? The sun takes her time climbing over the mountains. The food should take time too."

The eggs sizzled gently under Carmen's care, golden and perfect. Sarah found herself studying the younger woman's technique-the angle of the spatula, the gentle shake of the pan, the way she seemed to listen to the cooking sounds.

"My abuela always says, 'La cocina no miente'-the kitchen doesn't lie. It tells you everything about the person cooking." Carmen glanced up with a mischievous smile. "So tell me, Mrs. Mitchell, what is your kitchen saying about you this morning?"

Sarah considered the question seriously, a habit from her detective days. "That I'm out of my depth but trying not to drown?"

"Exacto! That's the first step. You know what my kitchen says about me?" Carmen gestured at the now-perfect eggs, the fresh bread she'd apparently produced from somewhere, the small bowl of local cheese that had materialized during their conversation. "That I talk too much while cooking and forget to eat my own breakfast."

"Then you must join me," Sarah said quickly. "I mean, if you have time. I'm sure you have your own responsibilities-"

"My responsibility this morning is helping you feed those German tourists before they write a bad review on TripAdvisor." Carmen's eyes sparkled with humor. "I heard them talking about the 'authentic island experience' they were expecting. Frau Mueller seemed... how do you say... unimpressed with the rooster alarm clock."

Through the kitchen window, Sarah could see Herr Mueller examining the terrace railing with the critical eye of a building inspector, while his wife photographed what appeared to be a small gecko sunning itself on the breakfast table.

"They're not wrong to have expectations," Sarah admitted. "I advertised Casa Vista Verde as an authentic Canarian experience. Unfortunately, my authenticity seems to be limited to burning breakfast and setting off smoke alarms."

Carmen turned from the stove, her expression suddenly serious. "Sarah-may I call you Sarah?-you bought this house from my family. My bisabuela Elena built it with her own hands when she was younger than I am now. Every stone, every tile, every piece of wood was chosen with love. The house has good bones, good energy. It just needs someone who understands its rhythm."

She plated the eggs alongside thick slices of the local bread, adding slices of tomato rubbed with garlic and a drizzle of golden olive oil. "This is desayuno canario. Simple but complete. Like the islands themselves."

Sarah accepted the plate gratefully, surprised by how hungry she'd become. The first bite was a revelation-the tomato sweet and acidic, the bread nutty and substantial, the egg rich and perfectly cooked. "This is wonderful. How did you-?"

"Practice," Carmen said simply. "And patience. And maybe a little bit of magic passed down from the women in my family. My grandmother used to say that cooking is just another form of caring for people. You care about your guests, yes?"

"Of course."

"Then you can learn to cook for them. But first, let's get these Germans their breakfast before they start posting photos of the gecko on social media."

## Scene 3: Breakfast Terrace (7:15 AM)

The morning sun had climbed high enough to flood the terrace with golden light, transforming the rough stone table into something almost ethereal. Bougainvillea cascaded over the railing in brilliant purple torrents, while the distant sound of church bells drifted up from the village below.

Herr Mueller looked up from his guidebook as Sarah approached with the breakfast tray, his expression shifting from skeptical to cautiously pleased. "Guten Morgen, Mrs. Mitchell. This looks... quite good actually."

"Carmen-Miss Rodriguez-helped with the preparation," Sarah admitted, setting down the plates. "She's teaching me the proper Canarian way."

Frau Mueller photographed her breakfast before tasting it, a habit that had initially irritated Sarah but which she now recognized as a form of appreciation. "The tomato is very flavorful. Not like the ones in Bremen."

"Local varieties," Carmen explained, appearing with a pot of café cortado. "My uncle grows them in the old volcanic soil. Different minerals make different taste, you know?"

"Fascinating," Herr Mueller said, and seemed to mean it. "We are here to study the geological formations, but I had not considered the agricultural implications."

The conversation was interrupted by the distant sound of music-drums and whistles carrying on the morning air. Frau Mueller lowered her camera, frowning. "What is that noise?"

Sarah felt her chest tighten. She'd forgotten about the festival preparations Carmen had mentioned yesterday. "I believe there's some sort of local celebration-"

"Fiesta de San Lorenzo," Carmen said proudly. "The patron saint festival. Tonight there will be dancing, traditional music, fuegos artificiales-fireworks. Very beautiful."

"Fireworks?" Herr Mueller's fork paused halfway to his mouth. "How late will this... celebration continue?"

Sarah could hear the diplomatic challenge in his tone. She'd dealt with enough complainants during her police career to recognize the signs of brewing conflict. "I should have mentioned it in the booking confirmation. I apologize for the oversight."

"In Germany," Frau Mueller said carefully, "such events are typically concluded by ten o'clock, for consideration of residents and tourists."

Carmen's smile became slightly fixed. "In the Canary Islands, celebrations end when the saint is satisfied. Usually around two or three in the morning."

The silence that followed was filled with the sound of drums growing closer, as if the festival procession was making its way up the mountain road. Sarah found herself caught between her guests' reasonable expectations and her growing loyalty to her adopted community.

"Perhaps," she suggested, "this could be an opportunity to experience authentic Canarian culture? I understand the festival includes traditional foods, local crafts-"

"We did not come here for a cultural immersion experience," Herr Mueller interrupted. "We came for geological research and peaceful accommodation."

Carmen's posture shifted almost imperceptibly, her hospitality smile becoming more professional. "Of course, señor. I understand that not everyone appreciates our local customs. Perhaps next year you might choose accommodations in the resort area, where such disturbances are better controlled."

Sarah recognized the diplomatic blade hidden in Carmen's polite words. She'd used similar techniques herself when dealing with difficult witnesses-maintaining perfect courtesy while making one's position unmistakably clear.

"What Carmen means," Sarah intervened quickly, "is that we want all our guests to be comfortable. Let me think about possible solutions-perhaps quieter rooms for tonight, or I could recommend some evening geological tours that might take you away from the village during the loudest parts of the celebration."

Herr Mueller's expression softened slightly. "That would be... considerate."

"I know the perfect guide," Carmen added, her professional smile warming again. "My cousin Pedro leads night tours to see the volcanic formations under moonlight. Very romantic for geological research."

Frau Mueller actually laughed. "That sounds quite lovely, actually."

The drums were closer now, accompanied by the sound of children's voices singing in the local dialect. Carmen stood, listening with obvious pride. "They're practicing for tonight. The children's choir from the school-my niece Ana is with them."

Despite herself, Sarah found the music charming. It had a joy to it that reminded her why she'd fallen in love with the island in the first place. "It's beautiful."

"Sí, it is," Carmen agreed, then turned back to the Muellers. "But I will speak to my family. We can ensure the loudest celebrations stay in the plaza, away from the hillside. It's important that our guests feel welcome."

"That's very kind of you," Herr Mueller said, and Sarah could hear genuine appreciation in his voice. "We don't wish to interfere with your traditions."

"And we don't wish to keep you awake with our noise," Carmen replied. "This is how neighbors should treat each other, no? With respect and understanding."

Sarah felt something settle in her chest-a sense that perhaps she was beginning to understand the delicate balance of hospitality that successful innkeeping required.

## Scene 4: Cleanup Bonding (8:00 AM)

After the Muellers departed for their morning geological survey, Sarah and Carmen worked together to clear the terrace, their movements falling into an easy rhythm. Carmen stacked plates while Sarah collected cutlery, both of them comfortable in the morning quiet broken only by birdsong and distant village sounds.

"That was skillfully handled," Sarah said as they carried the dishes back to the kitchen. "The way you managed their concerns about the festival."

Carmen shrugged, running water into the sink. "Tourism is the lifeblood of the island, but so are our traditions. My family has been finding that balance for generations." She handed Sarah a towel for drying. "My great-grandmother used to say, 'The house must serve the family, but the family must also serve the house.' Same principle applies to the community."

"You mentioned your great-grandmother built this place?"

"Bisabuela Elena. She was... how do you say... formidable. Raised seven children after my bisabuelo died in a fishing accident. This house was her way of keeping the family together-they could live upstairs and rent rooms to travelers." Carmen's hands moved efficiently through the soapy water. "She spoke four languages and could negotiate anything. The children all learned hospitality from watching her."

Sarah found herself genuinely curious about the history embedded in the walls around her. "What was she like?"

"Tiny woman, but fierce. Never more than five feet tall, but she could stare down a drunk sailor or charm a customs official, depending on what the situation required." Carmen smiled at the memory. "She used to tell my grandmother, 'A good hostess makes every guest feel like family, but never forgets she is the head of the household.'"

"Wise woman."

"Very wise. And practical. She kept detailed records of every guest-their preferences, complaints, what made them happy. By the time she was fifty, people came back year after year not just for the rooms, but because Elena remembered their coffee preferences and asked about their families."

Sarah paused in her towel work, struck by the professional familiarity of the approach. "That sounds rather like detective work, actually. Building relationships, remembering details, understanding what motivates people."

"Exactly!" Carmen's eyes lit up. "My grandmother always said hospitality is like detective work, but in reverse. Instead of solving crimes, you prevent problems. Instead of catching people doing wrong things, you help them do right things."

The comparison was more apt than Carmen might have realized. Sarah had spent three decades reading people, predicting their behavior, finding the pressure points that would make them cooperate or confess. The skills weren't so different from what she was trying to learn now.

"I've been approaching this wrong," Sarah realized aloud. "Thinking of innkeeping as service work, when it's actually more like... community management."

"Sí, exactly. You're not just renting rooms, you're creating experiences. Good experiences require understanding people." Carmen handed her the last plate. "Speaking of which, you handled the Muellers very well. Many new innkeepers would have either dismissed their concerns or gotten defensive about local traditions."

"Years of police work," Sarah admitted. "You learn to find common ground between opposing parties."

"Police work?" Carmen's eyebrows rose with interest. "I knew there was something professional about the way you listen to people. What kind of police work?"

"Detective Inspector, Metropolitan Police. Fraud investigation, mostly, but I did my share of missing persons cases and community liaison work." Sarah folded the towel carefully. "Thirty years of it, until I decided I'd had enough of London winters and other people's problems."

Carmen was quiet for a moment, processing this information. "And now you're here, learning to solve the mystery of Canarian breakfast and German tourist complaints."

"It seemed like a simpler challenge at the time," Sarah said ruefully.

"Nothing about people is simple," Carmen replied. "But that's what makes it interesting, no? The Muellers, for example-they're not really upset about the festival noise. They're worried about feeling like outsiders, about not understanding the culture they're visiting. The noise is just the visible part of the iceberg."

Sarah nodded slowly. Carmen's insight was remarkably mature for her age. "And your solution-offering them a way to participate rather than just endure-addressed the real concern."

"My family has been welcoming strangers for four generations. You learn to see past the surface complaints to what people really need." Carmen dried her hands on her apron. "But enough about tourist psychology. I need to check on my grandmother before the festival preparations begin in earnest. Will you be joining us tonight?"

"I'm not sure I'd be welcome-"

"Sarah." Carmen's voice was gentle but firm. "You live here now. This is your community too. Elena would have expected her house to be part of the celebration."

The invitation was clearly sincere, but Sarah felt the familiar trepidation of the outsider. "I don't know the customs, the language-"

"You'll learn. That's how it works. Besides," Carmen grinned, "someone needs to keep an eye on you in case you try to cook something."

## Scene 5: Missing Person Call (10:30 AM)

Sarah was reviewing the inn's booking ledger in her small office when her mobile rang, the caller ID showing Carmen's number. She answered on the second ring, expecting a question about tonight's festival or perhaps lunch recommendations for the Muellers.

"Sarah?" Carmen's voice was tight with concern. "I'm sorry to bother you, but... has my cousin Elena come by the inn today? Elena Ruiz?"

"I don't believe so. Should she have?" Sarah set down her pen, detective instincts immediately alert to the tension in Carmen's tone.

"She was supposed to help with flower arrangements for the festival altar this morning. My aunt Teresa is organizing it, and Elena promised to be there at nine." Carmen paused, and Sarah could hear voices in the background-rapid Spanish, worried tones. "She never came. And she's not answering her phone."

Sarah glanced at the clock. "It's half past ten. How unusual is this for her?"

"Elena is never late for anything. Never. She's the most reliable person I know-more reliable than me, even. If she says she'll be somewhere at nine, she's there at five minutes to nine with everything she needs." Carmen's voice carried the strain of genuine worry. "My aunt has been calling for an hour. We've checked her apartment, her workplace-she works at the hotel in Santa Cruz-nobody's seen her since yesterday evening."

The familiar weight of professional concern settled in Sarah's chest. Twenty-four hours was early for official missing person protocols, but local knowledge trumped bureaucratic timelines every time. "When did you last speak with her?"

"Yesterday around six. She called to confirm the flower arrangements and said she was going to have dinner with friends in Los Llanos. She seemed fine-happy about the festival, excited about the altar decorations. Nothing unusual at all."

"These friends in Los Llanos-have you contacted them?"

"My aunt is doing that now. But Sarah..." Carmen's voice dropped lower. "Elena's car is missing too. Her little red Seat-it wasn't at her apartment this morning."

Sarah found herself reaching for the notebook she always kept nearby, professional habits dying hard. "Any places she likes to go? Regular routes she takes? Hobbies that might take her off the beaten path?"

"She loves hiking. Sometimes she goes up to Roque de los Muchachos to watch the sunrise, but she always tells someone when she does night hikes. It's not safe to go alone up there." Carmen paused, then added reluctantly, "My aunt wants to call the Guardia Civil, but she's worried they'll think we're overreacting."

"They might," Sarah admitted. "Young adults are allowed to change their plans without notifying family. But you know Elena better than they do. If you say this is unusual behavior..."

"It is. Completely unusual." Carmen's voice was firm. "Sarah, I know you're retired and this isn't your problem, but-"

"I could ask some questions," Sarah interrupted. "Informally. Just to help put your mind at ease. I know the right things to look for, the right questions to ask."

The relief in Carmen's voice was immediate. "Would you? I mean, I don't want to impose-"

"You're not imposing. I'm concerned too." Sarah was already standing, looking for her jacket and car keys. "Where should I meet you?"

"The community center. That's where the festival organizing committee is meeting. My aunt Teresa is here, along with most of Elena's friends and family. We were going to organize a search, but..."

"But you don't know how to organize it effectively," Sarah finished. "I'll be there in ten minutes. And Carmen? Try to keep people from trampling over any areas Elena might have been. If we need to look for tracks or evidence of where she went, we don't want them disturbed."

"Evidence?" Carmen's voice sharpened with alarm. "Sarah, you don't think something bad has happened to her?"

"I think Elena is probably fine and there's a simple explanation for all of this," Sarah said truthfully. "But when someone reliable becomes unreliable, it's worth taking seriously. I'll see you soon."

She ended the call and stood for a moment in her quiet office, feeling the familiar stirring of professional instincts she'd thought were dormant. Missing persons cases were like puzzles-every piece of information mattered, and the first few hours of investigation often determined whether the story ended happily or in heartbreak.

*So much for simple innkeeping,* she thought, grabbing her keys and heading for the door.

## Scene 6: Investigation Begins (11:00 AM)

The community center buzzed with anxious energy when Sarah arrived, voices overlapping in rapid Spanish punctuated by worried silences. Carmen met her at the entrance, her usual composed demeanor cracked by stress.

"Gracias for coming so quickly," Carmen said, leading Sarah toward a cluster of people gathered around a folding table covered with festival planning materials. "My aunt Teresa is over there-the woman in the blue dress. She's been coordinating the search efforts, but..."

"But she's not trained for this," Sarah observed, watching the group's body language. Worry was evident in every posture-people standing too close together, arms crossed defensively, animated gestures that spoke of frustrated helplessness. "Who have you reached so far?"

"Elena's work colleagues, her neighbors, the friends she was supposed to have dinner with in Los Llanos." Carmen consulted a handwritten list. "The friends say she never showed up last night. They waited until nine-thirty, then assumed she'd gotten caught up with festival preparations."

Sarah nodded, already forming a mental timeline. "So she disappeared sometime between leaving her apartment yesterday evening and failing to appear for dinner. What time did she usually leave for Los Llanos?"

"She said she'd leave around seven to get there by eight. It's only about a thirty-minute drive."

"Has anyone checked the route between her apartment and Los Llanos? Accident reports from last night?"

Carmen shook her head. "We thought of that, but we don't know who to call. My aunt Teresa speaks better Spanish than English, and the emergency services-"

"I can handle that," Sarah said. "Do you have Elena's car registration details?"

A woman in a blue dress approached them, her face etched with worry and determination. "You must be Sarah Mitchell," she said in accented English. "Carmen told me you were a detective in London. Thank you for helping us."

"Teresa Rodriguez," Carmen said quickly, "my aunt. Elena is her daughter."

Sarah shook Teresa's hand, noting the firm grip and direct eye contact. A strong woman dealing with every parent's nightmare. "I'm happy to help. Have you been able to contact all of Elena's regular companions? Work friends, hiking partners, anyone she might have made spontaneous plans with?"

"Most of them. But you know how it is with young people-so many friends on social media, casual acquaintances." Teresa's English was careful but clear. "We may be missing someone."

"That's normal. What about her phone? Has anyone tried tracking it?"

Teresa and Carmen exchanged glances. "We... don't know how to do that," Carmen admitted. "Is that something the police would do?"

"Eventually, yes. But there are other ways." Sarah pulled out her own phone. "If Elena has location sharing enabled with family members, or if she uses apps that track fitness activities... Carmen, are you connected on any social platforms? Instagram, WhatsApp?"

"Sí, both." Carmen was already scrolling through her phone. "Her WhatsApp shows last seen yesterday at 19:47-that's about ten minutes before she should have left for dinner."

"Good. That's consistent with your timeline. Any posts on Instagram? Stories, check-ins?"

"Nothing since yesterday morning. A photo of flowers from the market for the altar arrangements." Carmen showed Sarah the image-Elena's hands arranging white lilies, the timestamp reading 11:23 AM.

Sarah studied the photo, looking for details. The background showed what appeared to be a kitchen counter, white tiles, modern fixtures. "Is this at her apartment?"

"No, this looks like... oh." Carmen's eyes widened with recognition. "This is the hotel kitchen where she works. She must have been preparing the arrangements there during her lunch break."

"Which means she was at work yesterday and planned to use hotel flowers for the festival." Sarah made a note. "Teresa, has anyone spoken to her supervisor? Confirmed what time she left work, whether she seemed upset or distracted?"

"I called the hotel this morning, but her supervisor is off duty until this afternoon. The desk clerk said Elena finished her shift at six o'clock as usual."

Another piece of the timeline. Sarah felt the familiar satisfaction of information clicking into place. "So between six PM when she left work and seven-forty-seven when she last used her phone, something happened to change her plans."

"You think someone..." Teresa couldn't finish the sentence.

"I think there are several possibilities, and most of them are mundane," Sarah said gently. "Car trouble, a spontaneous invitation she couldn't resist, a family emergency she didn't want to worry anyone about until she had more information. But Elena sounds like someone who communicates her plans, so her silence is worth investigating."

Carmen nodded emphatically. "That's exactly right. Elena tells everyone everything. Sometimes too much information, my grandmother says."

"Then let's start with the assumption that she intended to communicate but was prevented from doing so." Sarah looked around the room, noting how many people had gathered. "How many cars do we have available for searching?"

"Six or seven," Teresa replied. "But searching for what? Where?"

"The route between her apartment and Los Llanos, first. Then any hiking trails or scenic spots she's mentioned recently. We'll organize systematic coverage rather than random driving around." Sarah felt the familiar clarity of purpose settling over her. "But before we start driving, let's make some phone calls and see if we can narrow down where to look."

## Scene 7: Community Response (12:30 PM)

Within two hours, Casa Vista Verde had transformed into an unofficial command center for the search effort. Sarah found herself coordinating from her dining room table, which was now covered with local maps, contact lists, and a timeline Carmen had helped her construct on a whiteboard borrowed from the community center.

"The hotel supervisor confirms Elena left at six yesterday, seeming perfectly normal," reported Pedro, Carmen's cousin who'd returned early from his geological tour guide duties. "She mentioned the festival to several co-workers and seemed excited about tonight's celebration."

Sarah marked this on the timeline. "That takes us to six PM. The car rental agency had no reports of accidents on the Los Llanos route last night, and the Guardia Civil confirms no incidents involving a red Seat Ibiza."

Teresa paced near the window, her phone pressed to her ear as she spoke rapidly in Spanish to someone. Carmen sat across from Sarah, fielding calls and translating information between Spanish and English for the growing group of volunteers.

"My aunt's friend works at the gas station on the main road to Los Llanos," Carmen reported. "She remembers Elena stopping there around six-fifteen. She bought fuel and a bottle of water, seemed normal and cheerful."

"Six-fifteen," Sarah noted. "That's fifteen minutes after leaving work, which is about right for the location. Did she mention where she was going?"

"Just said she was meeting friends for dinner and would see everyone at the festival tonight." Carmen consulted her notes. "So she was still planning to attend the festival at six-fifteen."

The front door opened and Frau Mueller entered, looking hesitant. "Excuse me, Mrs. Mitchell? We heard in the village about the missing young woman. Is there anything we can do to help?"

Sarah looked up, surprised but pleased by the offer. "That's very kind of you. Are you familiar with search and rescue procedures?"

"My husband and I are members of the Alpine Rescue Service in Bremen," Frau Mueller explained. "We have experience with missing person searches in difficult terrain."

"Herr Mueller is outside examining your maps," Carmen added, having gone to greet them. "He says the geological survey work gives him excellent knowledge of local terrain and access routes."

Sarah felt a surge of gratitude. Professional volunteers were invaluable in searches, bringing systematic approach and specialized knowledge. "That would be extremely helpful. We're trying to identify likely areas to concentrate our search efforts."

Herr Mueller entered with the borrowed maps, his expression serious but engaged. "The area between here and Los Llanos includes several hiking trail access points. If Miss Ruiz decided to make a spontaneous stop-perhaps to photograph something for the festival or to check on trail conditions-there are three locations where her car could be parked but not visible from the main road."

"Show me," Sarah requested, appreciating his methodical approach.

As Herr Mueller spread the topographical map on the table, pointing to marked trail heads and viewpoints, Sarah noticed how the room had filled with people. Carmen's extended family, Elena's co-workers, neighbors from the surrounding hills, even the German tourists-all focused on finding one missing young woman.

"This is remarkable," she murmured to Carmen. "In London, we'd be lucky to get this level of community response for someone who'd been missing a week."

"Elena is family to half the people here, and a friend to the other half," Carmen replied. "Besides, we take care of each other on the islands. It's how we survive."

Teresa approached the table, having finished her phone call. "I spoke with Elena's friend Maria in Las Palmas. Elena called her last week about borrowing hiking equipment-boots and a headlamp. She wanted to try a sunrise hike this weekend."

"This weekend?" Sarah's detective instincts sharpened. "Not necessarily yesterday?"

"Maria wasn't sure of the exact day. Elena said she wanted to go early, before the festival preparations got too busy."

Sarah studied the map, noting the elevation markers and trail difficulty ratings. "Carmen, what time does the sun rise here in August?"

"About seven o'clock."

"So for a sunrise hike, she'd need to start walking in the dark. Around five or five-thirty in the morning." Sarah traced possible routes with her finger. "But she didn't come home last night, which means either she planned an overnight camping trip..."

"Elena doesn't camp overnight," Teresa said firmly. "She's afraid of the dark in remote places."

"Or she got delayed or lost and had to shelter somewhere until daylight." Sarah looked around the room. "How many of these trail areas have mobile phone coverage?"

"Very little," Pedro answered. "Maybe one or two bars at the highest points, but most of the hiking areas are dead zones."

Which explained why Elena hadn't called for help or responded to the dozens of calls her family had made. Sarah felt pieces of the puzzle shifting into place. "I think we need to focus our search on the hiking trail access points between here and Los Llanos. Elena may have decided to scout locations for her sunrise hike and gotten into difficulty."

"But her dinner plans..." Carmen protested.

"She may have intended to make it a quick stop and gotten delayed. If she lost track of time or encountered problems, she might have decided it was too late and too dark to continue to Los Llanos." Sarah stood, energized by the emerging theory. "Let's organize search teams for the three locations Herr Mueller identified."

The room filled with purposeful activity as people began organizing equipment, assigning vehicles, and establishing communication protocols. Sarah watched the choreography of community response with professional admiration and personal warmth.

*Perhaps,* she thought, *this is what I came to the islands to find.*

## Scene 8: Chapter Resolution (2:00 PM)

The call came from Pedro's search team just as Sarah was beginning to worry about the afternoon heat affecting the searchers. Carmen answered her phone with a sharp "¿Sí?" then immediately began speaking rapidly in Spanish, her voice rising with excitement.

"They found her!" Carmen announced to the room. "She's safe-Elena is safe!"

The collective sigh of relief was audible, followed immediately by a burst of questions in multiple languages. Sarah felt her own shoulders relax as the tension she'd been carrying dissolved.

"Where?" Teresa demanded, reaching for her car keys.

"The Marcos y Cordero trail head," Carmen translated Pedro's continued report. "Her car is there, and they can see her hiking boots and backpack by the river. She's conscious and talking, but she appears to have injured her ankle."

"How badly injured?" Sarah asked, still thinking like an investigator.

Carmen listened for another moment. "Pedro says she's embarrassed more than hurt. She went to scout the trail for sunrise photography and took a wrong turn. When she tried to backtrack in the dark, she slipped on wet rocks and twisted her ankle. She's been sheltered by the old water channel maintenance hut since last night."

Herr Mueller was already folding up the maps. "That trail system is quite complex. Easy to become disoriented in low light conditions. We've seen similar cases in the Alps."

"But she's definitely all right?" Frau Mueller asked, and Sarah was touched by the genuine concern in her voice.

"Sí, just frustrated and thirsty. Pedro is giving her water now, and they're helping her to the car. She keeps apologizing for missing the flower arrangements."

Teresa laughed, a sound that mixed relief with mild exasperation. "That's my Elena. More worried about letting people down than about her own safety."

"She'll need her ankle looked at," Sarah noted. "Even minor injuries can become serious if they're not properly treated."

"My brother Carlos is a paramedic," Carmen replied. "He's already driving to meet them at the trail head."

As people began gathering their belongings and preparing to leave, Sarah found herself reluctant to see the impromptu community dissolve. The past few hours had given her more sense of belonging than her previous three months of solitary innkeeping.

"Mrs. Mitchell," Teresa approached her, taking both her hands in a warm clasp. "Thank you. Your experience, your organization-without you, we would still be wandering around worrying instead of searching effectively."

"I'm just glad Elena is safe," Sarah replied. "And please, call me Sarah."

"Sarah," Teresa repeated, smiling. "You must come to the festival tonight as our honored guest. Elena will want to thank you personally."

"And you have to see the altar arrangements she was so worried about," Carmen added. "My grandmother and I finished them this morning using Elena's design notes."

Sarah hesitated, old habits of social awkwardness reasserting themselves. "I wouldn't want to intrude on a family celebration-"

"You're not intruding," Herr Mueller interrupted, surprising everyone. "You're participating. There's a difference." He turned to his wife. "Gerta, we should stay for the festival as well. I think we've been approaching this island experience rather too narrowly."

Frau Mueller-Gerta-nodded emphatically. "That young woman's dedication to community traditions, even when she was injured and frightened... it's quite moving, actually."

Carmen beamed at them. "Perfect! I'll introduce you to my grandmother. She loves to explain the history of the festival to people who are genuinely interested."

As the room cleared, Sarah found herself alone with Carmen, helping to fold up the borrowed maps and clean the whiteboard. The Casa Vista Verde dining room looked remarkably normal considering it had served as search headquarters for half a day.

"That was well done," Carmen said quietly. "The way you organized everything, kept people focused, asked the right questions. Elena is lucky you were here to help."

"I'm lucky to have been able to help," Sarah replied, and realized she meant it. "I've been feeling rather useless these past months, struggling with breakfast and worrying about guest reviews. Today reminded me that I do have useful skills-they're just different from innkeeping skills."

"Maybe they're not so different," Carmen suggested. "Both require understanding people, solving problems, bringing order out of chaos. You just need to learn to apply detective skills to hospitality instead of crime."

Sarah considered this as she straightened the room. "You know, you may be right. Today felt... familiar. Comfortable, even. Working with people toward a common goal."

"And tonight you'll get to celebrate with people instead of just working with them," Carmen said with a smile. "Festival is about community, about recognizing what binds us together. Elena's safe return makes this year's celebration even more special."

"In that case, I'd better figure out what one wears to a Canarian patron saint festival."

"Something comfortable for dancing," Carmen replied immediately. "And maybe bring a jacket for later-the mountain air gets cool after midnight."

Sarah paused in her tidying. "Dancing? I don't really-"

"You don't have to be good at it. You just have to be willing." Carmen's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Besides, after today, you're practically family. And family is expected to participate in the embarrassing traditional dances."

"Wonderful," Sarah said dryly, but found she was smiling. "Just promise me you won't let me burn down the kitchen if I try to help with festival food preparation."

"Deal. But only if you promise not to disappear on any solo hiking adventures before teaching me proper police investigative techniques."

They shook hands solemnly, then both dissolved into laughter-the kind of laughter that comes after stress and fear have been resolved, when community and friendship have been tested and proven strong.

Through the kitchen window, Sarah could see the afternoon sun beginning its descent toward the western horizon, painting the volcanic peaks in shades of gold and amber. Tonight there would be music, dancing, food, and celebration. Tomorrow there would be new guests to welcome, new challenges to navigate, new opportunities to build the kind of community connections she'd discovered today.

For the first time since arriving on La Palma, Sarah Mitchell felt like she was exactly where she belonged.
