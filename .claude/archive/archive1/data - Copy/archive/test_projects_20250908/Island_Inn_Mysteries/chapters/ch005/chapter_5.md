# Chapter 5: The Search Begins

The first fingers of dawn were creeping through the kitchen window when Sarah heard the soft tap at the back door. She'd been awake for nearly an hour, unable to sleep after the revelations of the previous evening, nursing her second cup of coffee and watching the sky lighten over Santa Cruz's harbor.

Through the frosted glass, she could make out Maria's slight figure, shoulders hunched against the morning chill. Sarah hurried to unlock the door, pulling the younger woman inside.

"Maria, gracias por venir," Sarah whispered, glancing toward the stairs where her guests were presumably still sleeping. "Come, sit. Coffee?"

Maria's hands trembled as she accepted the warm mug, her dark eyes darting nervously toward the windows. "I shouldn't be here. If David knew..."

"He won't know. You said you had information about Elena?"

Taking a shaky breath, Maria leaned forward. "The old contract Miguel mentioned-it's not just about gambling debts. David has been buying up coastal properties through shell companies. Elena found out."

Sarah's detective instincts sharpened. "What kind of properties?"

"All along the protected coastline. Somehow he's getting permits that should be impossible." Maria's voice dropped to barely above a whisper. "Elena was asking questions, talking to people in the environmental office. She said she had proof of... what's the word... soborno?"

"Bribery," Sarah translated, her pulse quickening. "She had proof of bribery?"

"Sí. She was scared, Sarah. Really scared. She told me David threatened her-not directly, but..." Maria wrapped her hands around the coffee mug. "He said the family had ways of dealing with people who caused problems."

A chill ran down Sarah's spine. "When did she tell you this?"

"Three days before she disappeared. She was going to her art studio that night to get the documents. She said if anything happened to her, I should tell someone who could help." Maria's eyes filled with tears. "I was too frightened. I should have gone to the police immediately."

Sarah reached across the small kitchen table, covering Maria's trembling hand with her own. "You're telling someone now. That takes courage."

The sound of footsteps on the stairs interrupted them. Sarah quickly moved to the stove, making a show of preparing breakfast as Carmen appeared in the doorway, already dressed for the day.

"Buenos días, Sarah. I smelled coffee and..." She noticed Maria. "Oh, perdón. I didn't know you had company."

"Maria stopped by early to help with preparations for the search," Sarah said smoothly. "The Civil Guard helicopters will be here soon."

Carmen's face brightened with purpose. "Excellent. What can I do to help?"

Within an hour, Casa Vista Verde had transformed into a hub of activity. The Civil Guard had indeed arrived, their distinctive green uniforms and professional efficiency bringing both comfort and urgency to the situation. Sergeant González, a compact man with graying temples and sharp eyes, had set up a temporary command post in Sarah's dining room.

"Señora Mitchell," he said, studying the large map spread across her dining table, "your location is perfect for our operations. If you're willing, we'd like to use your inn as our volunteer coordination center."

"Of course," Sarah replied without hesitation. "Whatever you need."

As the morning progressed, Sarah found herself naturally falling into a role she hadn't expected. Volunteers began arriving-local fishermen who knew every cove and current, hiking enthusiasts familiar with the mountain trails, and residents from neighboring towns who had heard about Elena's disappearance. Carmen proved invaluable, translating rapid-fire Spanish and helping organize the growing crowd.

"You're good at this," Carmen observed as Sarah efficiently divided the volunteers into search teams, each equipped with radios, water, and detailed maps. "Have you done this kind of thing before?"

Sarah paused in her distribution of supplies. "Something like it. Different circumstances."

By noon, the inn's terrace had been converted into a bustling coordination center. Sarah had moved tables outside to accommodate the flow of searchers coming and going, and had organized a simple but effective system: arriving volunteers checked in at one table, received assignments and equipment at another, and reported back to a third when they returned from their designated areas.

The kitchen had become equally busy. Word had spread through the community, and local women began arriving with homemade food-thick sandwiches, thermoses of coffee, fruit, and energy bars. Sarah coordinated the food distribution while maintaining constant radio contact with the search teams.

"This is incredible," said Carmen, watching Sarah juggle multiple conversations in her improving Spanish while keeping track of each team's progress on a large whiteboard. "You've turned the inn into mission control."

The atmosphere was tense but hopeful. Search helicopters thundered overhead every twenty minutes, their mechanical drone punctuated by the crackle of radios and the murmur of conversation in multiple languages. Sarah noticed that many of the volunteers were tourists-British, German, Dutch-who had extended their stays to help with the search.

Around two o'clock, a weathered man in his fifties approached Sarah's coordination table. His sun-darkened skin and calloused hands marked him as someone who worked outdoors, but his clothing was clean and professional.

"Señora Mitchell? I'm Luis Vega from Tenerife Ecológica." He offered a firm handshake. "We're an environmental protection group. I heard about Elena's disappearance."

"Any help is welcome," Sarah said, marking another completed sector on her map. "Are you familiar with the search area?"

"Very familiar. We've been monitoring coastal development projects throughout the islands." Luis glanced around at the busy terrace, then lowered his voice. "I wonder if we could speak privately?"

Sarah asked Carmen to take over the coordination table and led Luis to a quiet corner of the garden. The sounds of the search operation continued around them-radio chatter, helicopter rotors, the distant calls of search teams.

"Elena contacted us about three weeks ago," Luis said without preamble. "She'd been documenting suspicious construction activity along protected coastlines. Permits being issued for areas that should be off-limits to development."

Sarah's pulse quickened, remembering Maria's morning revelation. "What kind of documentation?"

"Photographs, permit copies, correspondence between developers and local officials. She was building quite a file." Luis pulled out his phone, showing Sarah photos of pristine coastal areas. "These are some of the sites she was concerned about. All supposed to remain protected under European Union environmental law."

"Did she mention any specific developers or officials?"

Luis nodded grimly. "Several times she mentioned someone named David Herrera. Said he was using multiple company names to hide the scope of his operations." He paused, studying Sarah's expression. "You know this name?"

"He's Elena's nephew. He arrived from mainland Spain yesterday."

"Ah." Luis's expression darkened. "That's... interesting timing."

Sarah felt pieces of a larger puzzle beginning to align. "What exactly did Elena tell you about her concerns?"

"She said she'd discovered that several environmental impact studies had been falsified. Wetlands classified as wasteland, protected bird nesting sites listed as barren rock." Luis put away his phone. "She was planning to present her evidence to the European authorities. It could have shut down millions of euros in development projects."

The implications hit Sarah like a physical blow. This wasn't a simple family disappearance. Elena had stumbled onto something much bigger-a conspiracy that involved significant money and powerful people. The kind of situation where someone might genuinely be in danger.

"Did she say where she was keeping this evidence?" Sarah asked.

"She mentioned a secure location, somewhere she could work undisturbed." Luis frowned. "She was very careful about not revealing specifics. Said too many people were already involved."

As if summoned by their conversation, Rosa appeared at Sarah's elbow. The elderly woman had been quietly helping in the kitchen all morning, but now her weathered face was creased with worry.

"Perdón, but I heard you talking about Elena's papers," she said in careful English, clearly having overheard despite the lowered voices. "She told me she kept important documents in her art studio. Hidden where only she would know to look."

Sarah exchanged glances with Luis. "Rosa, has anyone been to the studio since Elena disappeared?"

"David went there yesterday after he arrived. Spent maybe an hour inside." Rosa's expression tightened. "This morning, very early, I saw him there again. He had boxes."

A cold certainty settled in Sarah's stomach. If David had access to Elena's evidence, and if he was indeed involved in the corruption Luis described, then Elena's disappearance took on a much more sinister character.

"We need to contact the Civil Guard," Sarah said.

"Already done," came a voice behind them. Sergeant González approached, his radio crackling with updates from search teams. "I couldn't help but overhear. Señor Vega, would you be willing to provide a formal statement about Elena Herrera's environmental concerns?"

"Absolutely," Luis replied. "I have copies of some of her preliminary research back at our office in Santa Cruz de Tenerife."

As the afternoon wore on, the search operation continued with methodical efficiency, but Sarah could sense the mood beginning to shift. The initial optimism was giving way to concern as team after team returned with negative reports. The coastal areas had been thoroughly searched, and the mountain teams were working their way through increasingly remote terrain.

Carmen found Sarah updating the search progress board as the sun began to sink toward the horizon. "Any word from the helicopter teams?"

"They've covered the obvious areas-beaches, visible caves, accessible clifftops. Tomorrow they'll start on the more difficult terrain." Sarah set down her marker and rubbed her temples. The day had been a blur of activity, but underneath the organized chaos, her detective instincts were working overtime.

"You think she's not out there, don't you?" Carmen said quietly.

Sarah looked at her friend, seeing the same concern reflected in her eyes. "I think we need to consider other possibilities."

As evening approached, Sarah called the volunteers together on the terrace. The setting sun painted the sky in brilliant oranges and purples, and the lights of Santa Cruz were beginning to twinkle in the distance. The mood was subdued but not defeated.

"I want to thank everyone for your efforts today," Sarah began, her voice carrying clearly across the gathered crowd. "We've covered an enormous amount of ground, and while we haven't found Elena yet, we've established a solid foundation for continuing the search."

Sergeant González stepped forward. "Tomorrow we'll expand our search radius and bring in specialized equipment for underwater searches. The weather forecast is good, so we'll have full helicopter support."

Luis Vega raised his hand. "My organization can provide volunteers familiar with the more remote environmental protection areas. Places that might not be on standard maps."

There were nods of agreement and murmurs of continued commitment. Sarah felt a warmth that had nothing to do with the mild evening air-this was a community pulling together in crisis, offering their time, skills, and resources without hesitation.

As the volunteers began to disperse, making plans for the next day's efforts, Maria approached Sarah hesitantly.

"I heard what Señor Vega was saying about Elena's research," she whispered. "There's something else I should tell you."

Sarah led her to a quiet corner of the now-emptying terrace. "What is it?"

"Elena asked me to remember a number. She said if anything happened to her, this number might be important." Maria pulled out her phone, showing Sarah a contact entry. "It's for someone in Brussels-European Environment Agency."

Sarah memorized the number quickly. Another piece of the puzzle, another connection between Elena's disappearance and her environmental work. The evidence was mounting that this was far more complex than a simple missing person case.

"Maria, I need you to be very careful," Sarah said seriously. "If David is involved in something illegal, and if he thinks you know about Elena's evidence..."

"I understand." Maria's voice was steady despite her obvious fear. "But I can't let Elena down again. Tomorrow I'll take you to her studio, show you where she might have hidden things."

As the evening deepened and the last of the volunteers departed, Sarah found herself alone on the terrace with Carmen. The sounds of the search operation had faded, replaced by the gentle evening sounds of Santa Cruz-distant traffic, music from waterfront restaurants, the soft wash of waves against the harbor walls.

"Quite a day," Carmen observed, settling into one of the terrace chairs with a glass of wine.

"Indeed." Sarah joined her, accepting a glass gratefully. The wine was local, crisp and dry with a mineral finish that spoke of volcanic soils. "I haven't coordinated an operation like this in years."

"It showed. You were completely in your element." Carmen studied Sarah's profile in the lamplight. "I'm beginning to understand why you were so successful as a detective."

Sarah smiled ruefully. "This felt different. In London, cases were... more impersonal. Professional. This feels personal."

"Because it is personal. Elena isn't just a case number-she's part of this community you're becoming part of."

They sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes, processing the day's revelations. Sarah's mind was already working on the next day's priorities: coordinating with Luis to review Elena's environmental research, accompanying Maria to the art studio, and maintaining the volunteer coordination center while the official search continued.

"Sarah," Carmen said eventually, "what do you really think happened to Elena?"

Sarah set down her wine glass and looked out over the lights of Santa Cruz. The question she'd been avoiding all day, the conclusion her detective instincts had been leading her toward despite her hopes.

"I think Elena discovered something that threatened powerful people. I think she tried to be careful, but not careful enough." She turned to meet Carmen's eyes. "I don't think she's lost in the mountains or injured on a beach. I think someone made sure she couldn't reveal what she'd learned."

The words hung heavy in the evening air between them. Carmen nodded slowly, understanding the implications.

"So what do we do?"

"We keep searching, because we have to. But we also start investigating. Quietly, carefully." Sarah stood, suddenly energized despite the long day. "Elena trusted Rosa, and Rosa trusted me. I think tomorrow we're going to find out exactly what Elena discovered that made her so dangerous."

As they prepared to go inside, Sarah took one last look at the search coordination setup on the terrace. Tomorrow it would spring back to life with renewed purpose. But tonight, in the quiet of the Canary Islands evening, she allowed herself to acknowledge what she'd been trying to ignore all day.

Elena Herrera's disappearance was beginning to look less like an accident and more like a crime. And despite being officially retired from detective work, Sarah Mitchell was about to find herself investigating the most important case of her career.

The search for Elena Herrera was just beginning, but Sarah suspected they were looking for more than a missing person. They were looking for justice.
