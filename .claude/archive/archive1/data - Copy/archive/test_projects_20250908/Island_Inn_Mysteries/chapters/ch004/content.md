# Chapter 4

The morning fog rolled in from the Atlantic as Sarah stood at her window, watching the fishing boats return to harbor. She'd been up all night thinking about Elena Herrera's disappearance.

"Buenos días," Carmen called from the courtyard below. "I have news about Elena!"

Sarah quickly dressed and met her friend downstairs. Carmen's face was grave.

"My cousin works at the bank," Carmen whispered. "Elena withdrew a large sum of money three days before she disappeared."

The kitchen itself seemed to pulse with warmth-the ancient Aga stove that had come with the inn radiating heat like a benevolent dragon, the copper pots hanging from wrought-iron hooks catching the amber light of evening. She'd fallen in love with this kitchen the moment she'd seen it, recognizing it as the heart of the inn, the place where strangers became friends over shared meals.

"You should be resting," Carmen said, entering through the back door with a basket of fresh bread from Panadería Díaz. The aroma of warm pan candeal-sweet, yeasty, with hints of anise-filled the kitchen, momentarily masking the complex scent of the sofrito Sarah had simmering on the stove. Each bubble that broke the surface released notes of garlic, onion, tomato, and the special combination of herbs that made this recipe uniquely Palmero.

"Rest can wait," Sarah replied, though she gratefully sank onto the worn wooden stool she'd positioned strategically by the stove. "Sergeant Torres needs time to organize the search teams, and sitting still has never been my strong suit. Idle hands and all that."

Carmen set down the bread and studied Sarah with an expression that reminded Sarah of her own mother-concern mixed with exasperation and a touch of admiration. "You pushed yourself hard today. The Caldera doesn't forgive easily. My grandmother would say the mountain already tested you-no need to test yourself further."

"Your grandmother sounds like she was full of wisdom." Sarah smiled, adjusting the flame under her pot with the practiced ease of someone who'd learned that cooking, like investigation, was all about patience and observation. "This sofrito recipe-is it one of hers?"

"Her mother's actually. Passed down through generations like an heirloom." Carmen moved to help, her knife work efficient and precise as she chopped fresh cilantro, the green scent bright and clean. "The secret is the proporti-the Herrera family asked if we could send dinner over tonight. They're gathering to discuss... the situation."

Sarah's detective instincts sharpened despite her exhaustion, like a hunting dog catching a scent. "The whole family?"

"Rosa called about an hour ago. Said David is flying in from Tenerife-Elena's nephew, the lawyer. Apparently, he's taking charge of organizing the family's response." Carmen's tone suggested opinions about David that politeness prevented her from voicing.

"David Herrera," Sarah mused, stirring the sofrito slowly. "Elena mentioned him once. Said he was brilliant but had lost his way chasing money."

"That's a kind way of putting it. He's a development lawyer-specializes in converting traditional properties into tourist investments. Half the old fincas that are now boutique hotels? David brokered those deals."

"I'll deliver the food myself," Sarah said, perhaps too quickly.

Carmen raised an eyebrow, a gesture that conveyed volumes. "Your feet-"

"Will survive another short walk. Besides, it's the neighborly thing to do, isn't it? Supporting the family during a difficult time?"

A knowing look crossed Carmen's face, the corner of her mouth twitching with suppressed amusement. "And if you happen to observe the family dynamics while you're there..."

"Pure coincidence," Sarah said with an innocent expression that had never fooled her husband and certainly didn't fool Carmen.

An hour later, Sarah carefully loaded covered dishes into Carmen's battered Seat Ibiza for the short drive to the Herrera house. Her feet protested even the minimal walking, each step feeling like she was treading on broken glass, but she'd taken ibuprofen and rewrapped the bandages with the determination of someone preparing for battle. The discomfort was worth it for the opportunity to observe the family in their natural environment, especially with this David arriving from Tenerife like a circling vulture.

The Herrera home sat on a hillside overlooking the Atlantic, a traditional Canarian house that seemed to have grown from the very rock it stood on. The wooden balconies, painted green in the old style, created deep shadows in the evening light. Built by Elena's grandfather with his own hands, according to Carmen, it had housed four generations of the family, each adding their own touches while respecting the original structure. The volcanic stone walls glowed amber in the setting sun, and the sound of animated voices-some raised in anger, others in placation-carried through the open windows like a discordant symphony.

Sarah parked and gathered the first load of dishes, limping slightly as she approached the ornate wooden door carved with symbols she recognized as Guanche-the indigenous people who'd inhabited these islands before the Spanish arrived. Before she could knock, it swung open to reveal Rosa Herrera, Elena's daughter. Her eyes were red-rimmed and swollen, and stress had etched new lines around her mouth since Sarah had last seen her at the Fiesta de la Cruz, where she'd danced with such joy.

"Señora Mitchell," Rosa said, surprise evident in her voice. "Carmen said she would-I didn't expect-"

"Carmen's managing the inn. I wanted to come personally to express my support." Sarah held up the covered dish, its weight reassuring in her hands. "And to bring your mother's favorite dish-Carmen insisted on making it exactly as Elena taught her. Every ingredient, every step."

Rosa's eyes welled with tears that she quickly blinked away. "Mamá's albondigas... she always said Carmen was the only one who made them properly besides her. She'd spend hours teaching people, but somehow only Carmen got the texture exactly right." She stepped aside, her movements automatic. "Please, come in. Let me help you."

"There are more dishes in the car," Sarah said, allowing Rosa to take the pot while memorizing the house's layout-an old habit that died hard. Three exits visible from the entrance, stairs leading both up and down, the sound of voices coming from the right.

"You shouldn't be walking so much with those injuries," Rosa said, noticing Sarah's gait.

"Movement helps healing," Sarah lied smoothly, returning for the rest of the food despite her feet's vehement protests.

The interior of the Herrera house was a study in contrasts that told the story of a family caught between tradition and modernity. Traditional architecture with exposed wooden beams darkened by age housed modern amenities-a flat-screen television, contemporary lighting. Family photographs spanning decades covered one wall like a timeline of joy-weddings, baptisms, festivals-alongside what was clearly Elena's art: bold abstract paintings that somehow captured the essence of La Palma's landscape without depicting it literally.

The sound of raised voices grew clearer as they moved toward the dining room, the words becoming distinguishable.

"-don't care what the old contract says!" A male voice, frustrated and slightly slurred, words running together at the edges. "Abuela wouldn't just disappear without telling someone! She wouldn't leave us wondering-"

"Miguel, please." A woman's voice, placating but with an edge of fear. "Getting angry won't help find her."

Sarah and Rosa entered the dining room to find the family gathered around a massive wooden table that looked like it had hosted countless family meetings, its surface marked by generations of use-ring stains from wine glasses, scratches from children's toys, the patina of countless hands. Miguel Herrera sat at one end, a glass of red wine in his hand-not his first, judging by the empty bottle nearby. His face was flushed with emotion or alcohol, possibly both. Beside him, a petite woman Sarah recognized as his wife Maria twisted a linen napkin nervously in her hands, the fabric already showing her distress.

Around the table sat other family members Sarah knew by sight from her months of observing the community-Elena's younger son Roberto, steady and serious where Miguel was volatile; his wife Isabel, a mainland woman who'd never quite fit in; teenage grandchildren whose names she couldn't recall but whose faces showed the sullen worry of youth confronted with adult problems; and an elderly aunt who was dozing in her chair despite the heated discussion, her head tilted back and soft snores occasionally punctuating the conversation.

"The food," Rosa announced, perhaps louder than necessary, her voice cutting through the tension. "Sarah was kind enough to bring it herself."

The room fell silent, all eyes turning to the English innkeeper like compass needles finding north. Sarah felt the weight of their assessment-outsider, foreigner, but also the woman who'd spent the day searching for Elena, who'd come back injured from the effort.

"Señora Mitchell," Miguel stood unsteadily, gripping the table edge for support. "Thank you for today. Carmen told us you found Abuela's walking stick, that you pushed yourself despite-" he gestured vaguely at her feet.

"We did find it," Sarah confirmed, setting down the dishes with careful movements. "Sergeant Torres has it now. He's confident it will help narrow the search area."

"You injured yourself looking for her," Maria observed quietly, her English surprisingly good, only lightly accented. "We're grateful. Not everyone would do that for someone they barely knew."

"Anyone would do the same," Sarah deflected, though she noted Maria's keen observation, the intelligence in her eyes that her nervous demeanor tried to hide. "Elena is important to this community. She made me feel welcome when I was a stranger here."

"Yes, she is important," a new voice said from the doorway, smooth and controlled like expensive whiskey. "Which makes her disappearance all the more concerning."

The man who entered commanded immediate attention, changing the room's atmosphere like a sudden drop in barometric pressure. David Herrera was perhaps forty-five, with silver threading through his dark hair in a way that suggested distinction rather than age. His suit was expensive-Italian, Sarah judged, perfectly tailored-and seemed deliberately out of place in the rustic dining room, a statement of difference. His resemblance to Elena was striking-the same sharp cheekbones and penetrating gaze-but where Elena's eyes held warmth like a hearth fire, David's were calculating, cold as Atlantic depths.

"David," Rosa said, tension evident in her voice, her shoulders tightening. "You made good time from Tenerife."

"I chartered a flight as soon as I heard." He moved into the room with a lawyer's confidence, each step measured, his gaze sweeping over everyone before settling on Sarah with the focus of a raptor spotting prey. "And you must be the English detective Carmen mentioned. The one who's been... involved."

"Former detective," Sarah corrected, meeting his gaze steadily. "Now just a concerned neighbor."

"How fortunate that Aunt Elena has such... dedicated neighbors." The pause before 'dedicated' was deliberate, loaded with implications Sarah couldn't quite parse. "I understand you've been quite involved in the search efforts. Some might say remarkably involved for someone so new to our community."

"As has half the island," Sarah said mildly, refusing to rise to the bait. "Your aunt is well-loved."

"Indeed. Love can be quite motivating." David moved to the head of the table, the seat that would traditionally belong to Elena. Several family members shifted uncomfortably, Roberto's jaw tightening visibly. "We need to discuss how to proceed. The police seem to be treating this as a criminal matter, which could cause unnecessary complications."

"Complications?" Roberto spoke up, his voice steady but with an undercurrent of anger. "Mamá is missing, possibly hurt. What complications matter more than finding her?"

David's smile was patient, condescending, the expression of someone explaining simple concepts to slow children. "Roberto, you must think beyond the immediate. The family has business interests to protect, a reputation built over generations. If word spreads that Elena was involved with criminals-this German they're hunting-it could damage our standing, affect property values, impact ongoing negotiations."

"What negotiations?" Miguel asked, his words slightly slurred but his attention sharp.

"The conservation easement, for one," David said smoothly, producing a folder from his briefcase as if he'd been waiting for the question. "The hotel development group won't want to be associated with scandal. They're offering three million euros for the northern parcels-the ones with the old shepherd paths."

"Abuela would never agree to any hotel development," Miguel said hotly, wine sloshing dangerously in his glass. "She said the land should remain-"

"What Elena wanted and what's best for the family's future might not align," David interrupted with the smooth efficiency of someone who'd had this argument before. "We need to be realistic about her... condition."

Sarah's instincts prickled like static electricity before a storm. "Her condition?"

David turned to her with practiced sympathy, the kind lawyers perfect for juries. "My aunt is seventy-eight years old, Señora Mitchell. She's been showing signs of confusion lately-forgetting appointments, making unfounded accusations about perfectly legitimate business proposals. This obsession with rare plants and supposed criminals... it speaks to a declining mental state. Classic paranoid delusions, according to the specialist I consulted."

"That's not true!" Rosa protested, her hands clenched into fists. "Mamá's mind is sharp as ever! She beat us all at cards just last week, remembered every play-"

"Is it sharp?" David's voice remained calm, reasonable, terrifying in its certainty. "She's been spending days alone in the mountains, talking about protecting plants from imaginary threats. She accused respected businessmen of being thieves based on nothing more than intuition. Now she's disappeared, possibly wandering confused somewhere, possibly fallen and injured because she refused to accept her limitations."

Sarah bit her tongue hard enough to taste copper, wanting to mention the very real evidence of Klaus Weber's illegal activities, but Sergeant Torres had asked them to keep those details confidential for now. The investigation was at a delicate stage.

"The old contract proves she was right," Miguel muttered into his wine glass, the words barely audible but landing like a grenade.

The room went still as a held breath. David's expression hardened almost imperceptibly, a muscle jumping in his jaw.

"What old contract?" he asked quietly, his voice carrying a dangerous edge.

Miguel looked up, seeming to realize he'd said something he shouldn't have. Maria's hand tightened on his arm, her knuckles white.

"Nothing," Miguel said quickly. "I misspoke. The wine..."

"Miguel's had a difficult day," Maria said, her intervention smooth but desperate. "We all have. Perhaps we should eat before the food gets cold? It would be disrespectful to waste what Sarah brought."

"Yes," Rosa agreed eagerly, grasping the lifeline. "Sarah, would you stay? There's more than enough, and you should rest those feet."

"I couldn't impose-"

"Please," Rosa insisted, and Sarah caught the plea in her eyes, the desperate request for a witness. An outsider's presence might keep the family dynamics from exploding entirely.

"Just for a few minutes," Sarah agreed, allowing herself to be seated between Rosa and the dozing aunt, who woke long enough to pat Sarah's hand and mumble something in Spanish about "la inglesa buena" before drifting off again.

As the family served themselves, the act of sharing food temporarily defusing tensions, conversation turned to safer topics-the weather patterns suggesting early rain, upcoming festivals, tourist season beginning. But Sarah observed the undercurrents with professional attention. David's presence had shifted the entire family dynamic like a chess piece that changed the whole board. Roberto and his wife kept exchanging worried glances, entire conversations in their eyes. The teenage grandchildren stayed silent, unusual for Spanish teenagers at a family dinner. Miguel continued drinking steadily, refilling his glass with mechanical precision, while Maria watched him with poorly concealed anxiety, occasionally moving the wine bottle incrementally further from his reach.

"Señora Mitchell," David said suddenly, his voice cutting through the tentative peace like a blade. "I understand you've been on the island less than six months?"

"Four months," Sarah confirmed, meeting his gaze directly.

"And yet you've inserted yourself quite thoroughly into local affairs." His tone was pleasant, conversational, but the words carried an edge sharp enough to cut. "Rather remarkable integration for someone who, I understand, doesn't even speak fluent Spanish."

"I've been welcomed by the community," Sarah replied evenly. "Your aunt was one of the first to make me feel at home. She said the island needed new blood, new perspectives."

"How generous of her. Though I wonder if her judgment about people has been as impaired as her judgment about business matters." He paused, swirling his wine thoughtfully. "She's been quite trusting lately. Too trusting, some might say."

"David," Roberto warned, his voice low.

"I'm simply pointing out that Aunt Elena has been making questionable decisions lately. Trusting strangers, making wild accusations about established business partners, refusing to consider the family's financial future." He paused, sipping his wine with deliberate slowness. "Did you know she's been investigating legitimate agricultural export companies? Claiming they're stealing plants? She even went to the Guardia Civil with her concerns."

Sarah kept her expression neutral, though her pulse quickened. "She mentioned concerns about conservation."

"Paranoid delusions," David said dismissively, waving his hand as if brushing away cobwebs. "These companies have permits, official documentation, environmental impact studies. But Elena insisted they were criminals. She even threatened to go to the environmental protection agency with her 'evidence'-which consisted of nothing more than her own sketches and wild theories. She was going to embarrass the family, damage relationships we've spent years building."

"When did she threaten this?" Sarah asked, her detective instincts fully engaged now.

David seemed to realize he'd said too much. His expression smoothed into professional blandness. "Recently. The point is, her mental state has been deteriorating. This disappearance is likely just another symptom-wandering off, forgetting where she was going. It happens with the elderly."

"You speak as if she's already dead," Miguel said suddenly, his voice loud in the quiet room, wine glass slamming down hard enough to crack.

"Miguel!" Maria hissed, her face pale.

"No, it needs to be said!" Miguel stood unsteadily, gripping the table. "David's been trying to declare Abuela incompetent for months, trying to get power of attorney. He had papers drawn up, tried to get Roberto to sign them. Now she's conveniently missing, and he's here taking over, sitting in her chair, talking about business deals she opposed with every fiber of her being!"

"You're drunk," David said coldly, his mask slipping to reveal genuine anger. "And drowning in debt, from what I hear. Gambling debts, weren't they? How much do you owe now, cousin? Fifty thousand? Sixty? Or has it reached seventy with the interest?"

Miguel's face went pale, then red, the wine glass trembling in his hand. Maria made a small sound of distress, her hand flying to her mouth.

"That's enough," Roberto intervened, standing as well. "Both of you. This isn't helping find Mamá."

"No, but it does explain why some family members might be desperate enough to-" David let the sentence hang like a sword over their heads.

"To what?" Miguel demanded, his voice breaking. "Say it! Say what you're thinking!"

"Desperate people do desperate things," David said smoothly, his composure returned. "And Elena's life insurance policy is quite substantial, I believe. Plus her properties, her art collection. Quite a inheritance for her struggling children."

The room erupted like a volcano. Miguel lunged across the table, wine and dishes scattering, only Roberto's quick intervention preventing him from reaching David. Rosa was crying, harsh sobs that shook her whole body. The teenagers fled to another room, their footsteps thundering on the stairs. The elderly aunt woke fully and began loudly berating everyone in rapid Canarian Spanish, her voice carrying the authority of age even if her words were unclear.

Sarah stood quietly in the chaos. "I should go."

"Yes," David agreed, also standing, straightening his tie with precise movements. "This is a family matter, after all. Private family business."

As Rosa walked Sarah to the door, navigating around overturned chairs and spilled wine, she gripped Sarah's arm with desperate strength. "It's not true, what David says about Mamá's mind. She was sharp, focused, brilliant. The plants she was investigating-she had proof, real proof."

"What kind of proof?"

Rosa glanced back toward the dining room where voices were still raised, then leaned closer, her breath warm against Sarah's ear. "She hid something. Told me if anything happened to her, to look where she kept her mother's recipes. Said it would explain everything. But I've looked everywhere in her kitchen, found nothing."

"Maybe she didn't mean the kitchen," Sarah suggested gently, her mind already working through possibilities.

Rosa's eyes widened with sudden understanding, her grip tightening. "The studio. She has a painting of her mother cooking-she always joked it was her mother's best recipe, the recipe for truth. Oh God, I need to look-"

"Tomorrow," Sarah said firmly, covering Rosa's hand with her own. "With witnesses. With the police, perhaps. Don't go alone."

Rosa nodded reluctantly, fear replacing excitement. "You're right. David's already suspicious. If he thought I found something... He's not just here for the family meeting. He brought papers, legal documents. He wants us to sign something about Mamá's competency, about transferring authority."

She didn't finish, but Sarah understood. David Herrera was more than just a controlling family member. There was something darker here, something that made Rosa afraid of her own cousin, afraid in her own family home.

As Sarah drove back to Casa Vista Verde, her exhausted body protesting every movement needed to operate the vehicle, her mind raced through the evening's revelations. The "old contract" Miguel had mentioned-what was that about? David's urgency to declare Elena incompetent, his knowledge of her environmental investigations, his presence at the family table like a wolf among sheep-it all pointed to motives beyond mere family concern.

The headlights cut through gathering darkness, illuminating the winding road that had become familiar these past months. Every turn revealed new angles of suspicion. David knew too much, controlled too much, wanted too much.

Carmen was waiting in the inn's kitchen, cleaning already-clean surfaces in that way she did when anxious, the copper pots reflecting her worried face.

"How was it?" she asked immediately, abandoning pretense.

Sarah sank into a chair, finally allowing her exhaustion to show, her mask dropping. "Illuminating and disturbing in equal measure. David Herrera is definitely hiding something. He knew about Elena's investigation into the plant theft, tried to dismiss it as paranoia. He's brought legal papers, wants the family to declare her incompetent. And Miguel mentioned something about an 'old contract' that seemed to upset David greatly."

Carmen's eyes sharpened with interest. "Old contract? My grandmother mentioned something once about land contracts from the Franco era-documents that weren't always legal but were honored by tradition. Some families made deals they weren't proud of, deals that couldn't stand modern scrutiny."

"David also knew about Miguel's gambling debts-very specific numbers. That's not casual family knowledge."

"No," Carmen agreed slowly, understanding dawning. "That's leverage. David's a lawyer in Tenerife, handles property development. If he knew Miguel needed money, if he held Miguel's debts..."

"He could pressure him to support decisions Elena would never agree to." Sarah completed the thought. "Carmen, I think Elena's disappearance might not be about the plant poaching at all. Or rather, that might have been the catalyst, but the real danger came from inside her own family."

Carmen crossed herself reflexively, the gesture automatic. "Family betraying family-it's the worst sin in our culture. Judas in your own house."

"Rosa's frightened of David. She said Elena hid proof of something, told her where to look if anything happened. Elena knew she was in danger."

"You think David killed his own aunt?" Carmen's voice was horrified but not disbelieving.

"I think David wanted Elena out of the way, one way or another. Whether he acted on it himself or simply took advantage of her confrontation with Klaus Weber..." Sarah rubbed her tired eyes, the weight of the day crashing down. "We need to find out what this old contract is about. And we need to find whatever Elena hid before David does."

"Maria," Carmen said suddenly, snapping her fingers. "Miguel's wife. She pulled me aside while you were inside. Said she needed to talk to someone, but not tonight-Miguel was too upset, too drunk. She seemed... desperate. Like someone drowning, grasping for anything."

"She knows something," Sarah agreed. "The way she tried to stop Miguel from mentioning the contract, how she watched David-she's afraid but also protective of Miguel. Classic behavior of someone caught between loyalty and truth."

"She asked if we could meet tomorrow morning. Early, before the family wakes. She said she'd come here, pretend she was ordering special pastries for the family. Six-thirty, before David would be awake."

Sarah nodded, though even that small movement made her head swim with exhaustion. "We'll talk to her. But Carmen, we need to be careful. David made a point of reminding me I'm an outsider. He won't hesitate to use that against us if we get too close to whatever he's hiding. He's a lawyer-he knows how to use the system."

"You're not an outsider," Carmen said firmly, with the authority of someone stating absolute fact. "You risked your health today searching for Elena. You brought food to the grieving family. You bled on our mountain paths. You're part of this community now, whether David Herrera likes it or not. The mountain accepted you-that matters more than his opinion."

Sarah smiled tiredly. "Your grandmother's mountain tested me today. Now it seems the Herrera family will test me tomorrow."

"Then we face both tests," Carmen said simply. "Together. That's how we do things here-together."

As Sarah finally climbed the stairs to her room, every step an agony on her blistered feet, the old wood creaking familiarly under her weight, she thought about the evening's revelations. Elena Herrera had disappeared while investigating plant poaching, but the real threat might have been much closer to home. David's arrival had shifted the entire investigation's perspective like a kaleidoscope turning. This wasn't just about environmental crime anymore-it was about family secrets, old contracts, hidden debts, and possibly murder.

She collapsed onto her bed, not bothering to undress, her mind still churning despite her body's exhaustion. The moon cast silver light through her window, illuminating the painting she'd bought at a local market-a view of the Caldera that now held new meaning. Somewhere out there, Elena Herrera was either hiding or held captive-or worse. Klaus Weber was one threat, but David Herrera might be another entirely. And poor Miguel, drowning in debt and alcohol, had he been manipulated into something terrible? Or was he just another victim of David's machinations?

Tomorrow, Maria would come with her secrets. Tomorrow, they'd search Elena's studio for hidden proof. Tomorrow, the real investigation would begin.

But tonight, Sarah allowed herself a moment of vulnerability, alone in her room above the inn she'd bought on a widow's impulsive decision to start over. She'd come to La Palma to escape her past, to find peace in running a small inn on a beautiful island. To serve breakfast to tourists and watch sunsets from her terrace. Instead, she'd found herself in the middle of a mystery that threatened to tear apart one of the island's oldest families.

Her feet throbbed with each heartbeat. Her muscles ached in places she'd forgotten existed. Her head pounded with exhaustion and information overload.

And yet, for the first time in months, Sarah Mitchell felt truly alive. The gray fog that had enveloped her since retirement, since James's death, had lifted. She had a purpose again, a case to solve, justice to pursue. Elena deserved that. This community that had welcomed her deserved that.

The mountain had tested her strength today. The family had tested her resolve tonight.

Tomorrow would bring new tests, but Sarah would be ready. She'd faced down killers in London's darkest corners. She'd solved cases others had abandoned. She'd survived loss that had nearly broken her.

David Herrera, with his expensive suit and legal threats, didn't know who he was dealing with.

Elena Herrera deserved nothing less than the full truth, and Sarah Mitchell would find it.

The last thought before sleep claimed her was of Elena's walking stick, blood dried in its carved grooves. A grandmother's courage preserved in wood and blood.

Tomorrow, she would honor that courage.
