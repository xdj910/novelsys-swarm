# Chapter 9: Elena's Revelations

The morning sun streamed through the hospital windows, casting warm light across Elena Herrera's face as she sat propped up in bed, looking far stronger than she had two days ago. Sarah Mitchell entered the private room carrying a basket that Carmen had insisted on preparing-homemade tortilla española, fresh bread, and a thermos of proper coffee.

"Hospital food is terrible everywhere," Elena said with a weak smile, "but Spanish hospital food is a special kind of punishment."

Inspector Vega rose from his chair by the window. "Señora Mitchell. Elena insisted we wait for you before she told her full story."

"You didn't have to wait," Sarah said, setting down the basket.

"But I did," Elena replied, her voice gaining strength. "You risked everything to find me. You deserve to hear this first." She paused, looking between them. "The caves are the key to everything."

Sarah pulled a chair closer while Vega prepared his recorder. "Tell us everything, from the beginning."

Elena took a sip of water, gathering her thoughts. "It started six months ago. I couldn't sleep one night-my arthritis was acting up-so I went to my studio to paint. From there, you can see the harbor. I noticed boats arriving at unusual hours, always during the new moon when the nights are darkest."

"Fishing boats?" Vega asked.

"That's what I thought at first. But they moved wrong, stayed too close to the cliffs where the water is dangerous unless you know the hidden channels." Elena's eyes sharpened with the memory. "My husband's family were fishermen for generations. I know how boats should move in our waters."

Sarah leaned forward. "So you investigated?"

"Not immediately. I'm old, not foolish. But I started watching, making notes. The boats always went to the same area-the Cueva del Viento sector, but not the tourist section. There are other caves there, ones that flood at high tide."

"I followed them one morning," Elena continued, her voice dropping. "I know it was dangerous, but I had to know. I found a path, barely visible, marked with small white stones that looked natural unless you knew to look for them."

Vega was taking rapid notes. "Where did the path lead?"

"To a cave entrance hidden behind a fall of volcanic rock. Inside..." Elena paused, her hands trembling slightly. "They'd turned it into a warehouse. Crates, equipment, computers sealed in waterproof cases. But it was the labels that caught my attention-shipping marks from Tenerife, Gran Canaria, even as far as Madeira."

"What was in the crates?" Sarah asked.

"I couldn't open them, but I took photographs. Some were construction materials-nothing suspicious there. But others had pharmaceutical labels, electronics, luxury goods. Things that should go through official ports, pay proper taxes."

"Smuggling," Vega said grimly.

Elena nodded. "But that's not the worst part. I saw documents, development plans for areas that are supposedly protected. They're using the smuggling operation to fund illegal development, and the development provides cover for the smuggling. It's a perfect circle of corruption."

"Did you recognize anyone?" Sarah asked carefully.

Elena hesitated, and Sarah could see her struggling with something. "There was someone... but I can't be certain. It was dark, and they were at a distance. But the way they moved, their silhouette-it reminded me of someone I know. Someone trusted."

"Who?" Vega pressed.

"I can't say. Not without being sure. I won't destroy someone's reputation on a uncertainty." Elena's jaw set stubbornly, a flash of the strength that had helped her survive her ordeal.

Sarah recognized that look-Elena would reveal the name when she was ready, not before. "What happened next?"

"I took my photographs and left. I spent weeks researching, trying to understand the scope of what I'd found. That's when I contacted Ana Morales, the lawyer. I needed someone outside the local system, someone I could trust."

"And they found out," Sarah said.

Elena's face darkened. "I was careful, but not careful enough. Someone leaked my meeting with Ana. The morning I disappeared, I got a call warning me to stop. I was heading to the police station when they took me."

"Klaus Weber," Vega said.

"He was just hired muscle," Elena said dismissively. "He kept asking about my photographs, where I'd hidden them. But he was taking orders from someone else, someone he only referred to as 'the principal.'"

Sarah and Vega exchanged glances. This matched what Roberto had told them-Hamburg Development Group had a local partner, someone with power and connections.

"Elena," Sarah said gently, "where are the photographs?"

A small smile played at Elena's lips. "Safe. Hidden where only someone who truly knows me would look. But I'll tell you, Sarah. This afternoon, when we're alone."

Vega looked frustrated but didn't push. "We need those photos as evidence."

"You'll have them," Elena promised. "But first, you need to understand about the caves. They're more extensive than anyone realizes. My husband's grandfather used to tell stories-during the civil war, people hid in those caves for months. There are chambers that have never been mapped, passages that connect to the sea."

"We need to explore them," Sarah said.

"No!" Elena's vehemence surprised them. "Not without proper preparation. The tides are treacherous. Go at the wrong time and you'll drown. You need someone who knows them."

"Who?" Sarah asked.

Elena smiled. "Carmen's grandfather, Don Alejandro. He explored those caves as a boy, before they were declared too dangerous. If anyone knows their secrets, it's him."

After extracting a promise from Elena to rest, Sarah and Vega left the hospital. In the parking lot, Vega pulled Sarah aside.

"She knows who she saw," he said quietly. "She's protecting someone."

"Or protecting herself until she has proof," Sarah countered. "Elena's too smart to make accusations she can't support."

Vega nodded reluctantly. "I'll have officers watch the cave entrances, but discreetly. We don't want to alert whoever's using them."

"Carmen and I will visit her grandfather," Sarah said. "See what he can tell us about the cave system."

Sarah found Carmen at Casa Vista Verde, supervising lunch service. The inn had been busier than ever since Elena's rescue, with locals and tourists alike wanting to hear the story and show support.

"How is she?" Carmen asked immediately.

"Stronger. She's given us a lead-the caves near Cueva del Viento. She says your grandfather knows them."

Carmen's eyes widened. "Abuelo? He's ninety-two, Sarah."

"But his mind is clear?"

"Clear as crystal. He still corrects my Spanish grammar." Carmen untied her apron. "He'll be having his siesta now, but we can visit him for merienda-afternoon snack. He'll be more talkative with food."

They stopped at the library first, where Sarah wanted to research the geological surveys of La Palma's cave systems. The librarian, a young woman named Isabel, was eager to help.

"The volcanic caves? We have extensive materials, though much of it is technical." She pulled several large volumes from the reference section. "This is the official geological survey from 2010, but if you want the real information, you should look at this."

She produced a slim, hand-bound volume. "This was written by a local speleologist in the 1960s. He spent decades exploring and mapping caves that the government later declared off-limits."

Sarah opened the book carefully. The pages were filled with detailed hand-drawn maps, notes about tidal patterns, and warnings about unstable sections. It was a treasure trove of information.

"Can we copy this?" Carmen asked.

"I'll do better-I'll scan it for you," Isabel offered. "This information should be preserved digitally anyway."

While Isabel worked on scanning the book, Sarah and Carmen studied the official geological surveys. The cave system was far more extensive than Sarah had realized, with miles of mapped passages and probably miles more unmapped.

"Look at this," Carmen pointed to a section of the map. "These caves run right under the proposed development sites David was involved with."

"Perfect for moving materials in and out without anyone noticing," Sarah mused. "Construction equipment going in could hide smuggled goods coming out."

By four o'clock, they were driving up a narrow mountain road to Don Alejandro's house. The elderly man lived in a traditional Canarian home, its wooden balconies overlooking a ravine filled with dragon trees and Phoenix palms.

Don Alejandro was sitting on his terrace, a small glass of wine at hand, watching the afternoon light play across the mountains. Despite his age, his eyes were bright and alert.

"Carmen, mi niña," he said warmly, accepting her kiss on both cheeks. "And you must be the English detective who saved Elena."

"Just Sarah," she said, charmed by the old man's dignity.

"Just Sarah who organized half the island to rescue our Elena," Don Alejandro corrected with a smile. "Sit, sit. Carmen, bring the cheese and gofio. We'll talk properly."

Once they were settled with plates of local cheese, gofio (toasted grain flour), and sweet wine, Don Alejandro leaned back in his chair.

"Carmen says you want to know about the caves."

"Elena discovered they're being used for smuggling," Sarah said directly, sensing this man would appreciate honesty.

Don Alejandro nodded slowly. "It wouldn't be the first time. During the war-the Civil War-those caves hid Republicans fleeing Franco's forces. Before that, pirates used them to store plunder. The caves have always kept La Palma's secrets."

"Can you tell us about them?" Carmen asked.

The old man was quiet for a moment, then rose with surprising agility. "Wait here."

He returned with a leather portfolio, its edges worn with age. Inside were hand-drawn maps, yellowed with time but still clear.

"I made these when I was young and foolish," he said, spreading them on the table. "Before I had the sense to be afraid of dark, tight spaces and rising tides."

The maps were incredibly detailed, showing not just the cave passages but notes about everything-which sections flooded at high tide, where fresh water seeped through, which passages were stable and which might collapse.

"This section here," he pointed to a complex of caves near the coast, "we called it 'El Laberinto'-the labyrinth. The passages twist back on themselves. Easy to get lost if you don't know the markers."

"What kind of markers?" Sarah asked.

"Natural formations mostly-a rock that looks like a face, a pillar of white stone. But there were also man-made marks. Crosses carved by the pirates, later political symbols from the war." He traced a particular passage with a gnarled finger. "This one we called 'La Cueva del Alcalde'-the Mayor's Cave."

Sarah and Carmen exchanged glances. "Why that name?"

Don Alejandro chuckled. "An old scandal. Back in the 1950s, a mayor was caught using it to hide contraband cigarettes and liquor. He claimed he was just storing them for a friend." The old man's eyes twinkled. "The friend turned out to be his mistress's husband. It was quite the scandal."

"Are these caves still accessible?" Sarah asked.

"Some are. Others have been sealed by rockfalls or floods. But this one," he tapped a passage that seemed to connect several chambers, "this should still be open. It's above the high tide line, stable volcanic rock. If someone wanted to use the caves without being seen, this would be the way."

"Would you be willing to share these maps with the police?" Sarah asked.

Don Alejandro looked at her shrewdly. "The police, yes. But Sarah, be careful who else you trust. The caves have kept secrets for centuries because someone has always profited from them. That someone usually has power."

He carefully removed three maps from the portfolio. "These are the ones you need. The rest..." he smiled sadly, "are just an old man's memories of adventures better left in the past."

As they prepared to leave, Don Alejandro caught Carmen's arm. "Your grandmother would be proud of you, helping to right this wrong. But remember-the sea doesn't care about justice. If you go into those caves, respect the tides above all else."

They drove back to Casa Vista Verde in thoughtful silence, the maps safely tucked in Sarah's bag. As they pulled into the inn's parking area, Carmen suddenly grabbed Sarah's arm.

"Don't turn off the engine," she said urgently.


"What?"

"Something's wrong. I can hear it-the engine sounds different." Carmen was already out of the car, dropping to her knees to look underneath. Her face went pale. "Sarah, get out of the car. Now. Carefully."

Sarah obeyed, her heart racing. Carmen was under the vehicle now, using her phone's flashlight.

"The brake line," Carmen said, emerging with grease on her hands and fear in her eyes. "It's been cut. Not all the way through, just enough that it would fail after a few uses. Probably on the mountain roads."

Sarah felt a chill that had nothing to do with the evening air. The road from Don Alejandro's house was all sharp curves and steep drops.

"If you'd driven back tomorrow morning, after the fluid had completely leaked out..." Carmen couldn't finish the sentence.

Sarah pulled out her phone and called Inspector Vega. Within minutes, the parking area was filled with police vehicles.

"This was professional," the police mechanic confirmed. "Whoever did this knew exactly where to cut, exactly how deep. This was meant to look like an accident."

Vega's face was grim. "Someone knows you're getting close. Someone with access to the inn's parking area."

Sarah looked around at the familiar building, the place that had become her home. Someone had been here, someone who knew her routine, knew she'd be driving to Don Alejandro's house.

"There's a leak," she said quietly to Vega. "Someone in your department or someone close to the investigation."

"I know," he replied just as quietly. "From now on, we trust no one outside our immediate circle."

As the police processed the scene, Sarah stood with Carmen, looking out at the darkening Atlantic. The refined voice on the phone had warned her that islands could be dangerous places. Now that threat had become tangible, personal.

"They're scared," Carmen said suddenly. "Whoever did this, they're scared of what we might find."

"Good," Sarah replied, thinking of Elena lying in that hospital bed, of all the people who'd risked themselves to save her. "They should be scared. Because we're not stopping."

Carmen squeezed her hand. "No, we're not. But Sarah, we need to be smarter now. They've shown they're willing to kill."

Sarah nodded, her mind already working through possibilities. They had the maps, they had Elena's testimony, and somewhere out there were Elena's photographs. Tomorrow, they would start piecing it all together.

But tonight, she would make sure everyone was safe. She'd have Carmen stay at the inn, post someone to watch Elena's hospital room, and make sure Don Alejandro had protection.

The investigation had entered a new, more dangerous phase. But Sarah had faced danger before, and now she had something she'd never had in London-a community standing with her, protecting each other.

As she walked back into Casa Vista Verde, she thought about the caves Don Alejandro had described, keeping La Palma's secrets for centuries. Soon, those secrets would be revealed.

The question was whether she'd survive the revelation.
