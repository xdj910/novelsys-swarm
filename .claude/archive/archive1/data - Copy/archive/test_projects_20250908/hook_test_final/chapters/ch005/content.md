# Chapter 5

Detective Sarah walked through the misty streets of Tijarafe, her mind racing with new clues about Elena's disappearance.

"Carmen," she said urgently, "I found something important in Elena's studio."

Carmen looked up from her morning coffee preparation. "What did you find?"

"Hidden documents," Sarah replied. "Elena was tracking illegal plant smuggling operations. She had names, dates, shipping manifests."

"That's dangerous information," Carmen whispered. "No wonder she disappeared."

## Scene 2

The evidence was overwhelming. Elena had been building a case against Klaus Weber and his associates for months. Photos of rare Canarian plants being harvested illegally, GPS coordinates of protected areas, even audio recordings of suspicious conversations.

Sarah spread the documents across Elena's kitchen table. "She was going to turn all this over to the authorities. Someone found out and silenced her."
