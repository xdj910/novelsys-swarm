"Elena was a brave woman," she said to Carmen as they sat in the inn's kitchen. "She knew the risks but chose to document everything anyway."

Carmen nodded, stirring honey into her tea. "She always said the truth was worth any price. Even her life."

"The plant smuggling operation, David's involvement, the forged environmental permits - she had it all documented," Sarah continued. "Her journal saved this island's biodiversity."

The case had taken an unexpected turn when they discovered Elena wasn't just investigating Klaus Weber. Her own nephew David had been the mastermind, using his legal expertise to cover the operation's tracks.

"Justice for Elena," Carmen raised her teacup.

"Justice for Elena," Sarah agreed.
