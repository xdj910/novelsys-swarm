# Chapter 7

The investigation was reaching its climax. Sarah had gathered enough evidence to confront David Herrera directly.

"Carmen," she said, checking her notebook one final time, "I need you to call Sergeant Torres. Tell him to meet us at the Herrera house in one hour."

Carmen nodded gravely. "You think David will confess?"

"He doesn't have a choice. Elena's journal names him specifically. The plant smuggling operation, the forged permits, the bribery of environmental officials - it's all documented."

Sarah tucked Elena's journal into her jacket pocket. "Elena died because she discovered the truth about her own family. But her courage won't be in vain."

## Scene 2

The confrontation at the Herrera house was swift and decisive. When presented with Elena's evidence, David's carefully constructed facade crumbled.

"She was going to destroy everything," he admitted, his lawyer's composure finally breaking. "Generations of family reputation, business relationships, millions in development contracts."

"So you killed her," Sarah stated flatly.

David's silence was answer enough. Elena Herrera would finally have justice.
