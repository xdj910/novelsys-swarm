# Chapter 10

The morning after Elena's case was closed, Sarah Mitchell stood on the terrace of Casa Vista Verde, watching the sunrise paint the Atlantic in shades of gold.

"You've become part of this island," Carmen said, joining her with fresh coffee. "Elena would be proud."

Sarah nodded, feeling the truth of those words. La Palma had tested her, challenged her, and ultimately embraced her. The investigation had been more than just solving a case - it had been about finding her place in this new world.

"The plant smuggling network is completely dismantled," she said. "Klaus Weber is in custody, David Herrera faces multiple charges, and the rare species Elena died protecting are safe."

Carmen smiled. "And you found yourself again, Sarah. I saw the detective in you come alive."

It was true. The fog of grief that had followed her from London had lifted. In solving Elena's disappearance, she'd rediscovered her purpose.

## Scene 2

Later that morning, the inn was buzzing with guests enjoying breakfast. Sarah moved between tables, no longer the outsider but the heart of Casa Vista Verde.

Miguel Herrera arrived with his family, sober now and grateful. "Se√±ora Mitchell, we can never thank you enough. You gave us closure, and justice for Abuela."

"Elena gave us the truth," Sarah replied. "I just made sure it was heard."

As the Herrera family shared stories of Elena over coffee and pastries, Sarah realized this was her life now - not just running an inn, but being part of a community, solving problems, making a difference.

The detective had found her new beat: a volcanic island in the Atlantic, where mysteries ran as deep as the ancient lava tubes, and where an English widow could become a guardian of truth.
