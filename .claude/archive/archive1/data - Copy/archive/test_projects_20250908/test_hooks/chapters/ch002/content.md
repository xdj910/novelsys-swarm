# Chapter 2: The Missing Guest

Sarah Mitchell reviewed the guest registry once more. Room 237 had been occupied continuously for six months, yet no one had ever seen the guest.

"Mr. Blackwood checked in last February," Carmen whispered, glancing nervously at the door. "But I've never seen him leave the room. Food trays go in, empty trays come out. That's all."

Sarah's detective instincts were on high alert. This was more than just a reclusive guest.

## Scene 2: The Investigation Deepens

The master key felt heavy in Sarah's hand as she approached Room 237. The hallway seemed to grow colder with each step.

"Detective Mitchell," a voice called from behind. It was the hotel manager, Mr. Sterling, looking pale and worried.

"I must insist you don't disturb our guest," he said, though his voice trembled slightly.

Sarah noticed his hands were shaking. "Mr. Sterling, when did you last see Mr. Blackwood?"

The manager's silence spoke volumes.
