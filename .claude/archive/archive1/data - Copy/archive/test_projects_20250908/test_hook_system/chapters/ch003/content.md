Detective Sarah Mitchell walked through the narrow streets of Tijarafe, her mind racing with questions about the mysterious disappearance.

"Carmen," she called to her new friend, "have you noticed anything unusual about the Herrera family lately?"

Carmen hesitated. "Well, now that you mention it, Elena had been receiving strange phone calls recently."

"Ah, you're asking about Señora Elena," he said solemnly. "She seemed worried that last day. Kept checking her watch and looking toward the mountains."
