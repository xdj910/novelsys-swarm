# Chapter 13

Success at last. The Hook system should now be working properly with the fixed master-hook.sh that correctly reads JSON from stdin.

This test chapter verifies that:
- The master Hook receives JSON input
- It correctly parses tool_name and file_path
- It distributes the JSON to appropriate sub-Hooks
- Meta.json should be created
- Backup should be triggered
- All other Hooks should execute

Let's see if the magic happens!
