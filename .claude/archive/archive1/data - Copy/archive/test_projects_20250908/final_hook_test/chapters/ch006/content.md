# Chapter 6

The morning sun cast long shadows across the courtyard as Sarah prepared for another day of investigation.

"Elena's journal," she said to Carmen, holding up a leather-bound notebook. "I found it hidden in her studio, behind the painting of her mother."

Carmen's eyes widened. "What does it say?"

Sarah opened to the last entry. "She knew someone was following her. She wrote about suspicious phone calls, cars parked outside her house at night. And look at this..."

She pointed to a page filled with Elena's careful handwriting. Names, dates, locations - all connected to the plant smuggling operation.

"Miguel García, Klaus Weber, David Herrera," Sarah read aloud. "She suspected her own nephew was involved."

## Scene 2

At the police station, Sergeant Torres examined the journal with growing concern. "This changes everything, Señora Mitchell. If Elena discovered family involvement in the smuggling..."

"It gives David a motive beyond just financial gain," Sarah finished. "He wasn't just trying to control family assets - he was protecting himself from exposure."

The evidence was mounting. Elena Herrera hadn't simply disappeared - she had been silenced by someone she trusted.
