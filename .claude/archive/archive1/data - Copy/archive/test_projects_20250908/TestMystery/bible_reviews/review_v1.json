      "score": 67,
      "issue": "Only protagonist Liu Mingxuan has fully developed voice profile. Supporting characters like Chen Haitao, Wang Xiaomei lack distinct speech patterns and dialogue examples",
      "recommendation": "Add complete voice profiles for Chen Haitao (antagonist), Wang Xiaomei (witness), and victim's parents. Include speech patterns, vocabulary, mannerisms, and dialogue examples for each. Chen Haitao should have calculated, business-like speech with occasional cold undertones. Wang Xiaomei should have nervous, fragmented speech patterns reflecting her fear."

      "recommendation": "Develop unique narrative signatures: specific metaphor patterns (sea/fog metaphors for confusion/clarity), recurring sentence structures for tension (incomplete thoughts during suspense), signature transition phrases between scenes. Add unique perspective on small-town dynamics through narrator's observations."

      "issue": "Liu Mingxuan's emotional journey stages are too general. Lacks specific emotional beats and internal conflict details",
      "recommendation": "Detail specific emotional states for each chapter arc: Ch1-5 should show specific guilt manifestations (insomnia, avoiding certain locations), Ch6-15 add self-doubt moments when evidence contradicts assumptions, Ch16-25 show internal wrestling with moral implications through specific decision points, Ch26-30 show gradual peace through concrete acts of mercy."

      "recommendation": "Create detailed pacing map: every 3-4 chapters should have tension peak followed by reflection chapter. Ch4,8,12,16,20,24 should be high-tension discovery chapters. Ch6,10,14,18,22 should be character development/relationship chapters. Ch26-29 should accelerate rapidly to climax."
