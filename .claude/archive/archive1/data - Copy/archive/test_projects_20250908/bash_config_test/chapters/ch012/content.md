# Chapter 12

The aftermath of the trial brought unexpected changes to Casa Vista Verde. Sarah's role in solving Elena Herrera's disappearance had made her something of a local celebrity, though she preferred the quiet life she'd originally sought.

"Another journalist called," Carmen announced, entering the kitchen where Sarah was preparing breakfast. "This one from El País in Madrid."

"Tell them no thank you," Sarah replied, focusing on the perfect flip of a tortilla española. "Elena deserves the spotlight, not me."

Carmen smiled knowingly. "You can't hide from who you are, Sarah. Once a detective, always a detective."

It was true. Even as Sarah tried to focus on running the inn, her trained eye caught details others missed. The nervous tourist who kept checking over his shoulder. The local fisherman whose boat returned at odd hours. The patterns that didn't quite fit.

## Scene 2

That evening, as Sarah walked through Tijarafe's quiet streets, she encountered Inspector Vega.

"Señora Mitchell," he nodded respectfully. "I wanted to thank you again. Without your investigation, Elena's case would have remained unsolved."

"I just followed the evidence," Sarah said modestly.

"Perhaps," Vega paused, then continued carefully, "you might consider consulting with us occasionally? Your skills are... unique here."

Sarah considered this. She'd come to La Palma to escape her past, but perhaps she didn't need to abandon it entirely. Perhaps she could blend her old life with her new one.

"Unofficially," she said finally. "And only when truly needed."

Vega smiled. "Of course. Welcome to La Palma's extended police family, Detective Mitchell."

As Sarah walked back to Casa Vista Verde under the star-filled Atlantic sky, she felt complete for the first time in years. She was still a detective, just in a different paradise.
