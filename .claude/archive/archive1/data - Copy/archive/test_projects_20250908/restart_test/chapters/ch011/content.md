# Chapter 11

Sarah Mitchell had never imagined that her retirement would lead her to this moment - standing in a Canarian courtroom, her testimony about to bring down an international smuggling ring.

"Detective Mitchell," the prosecutor began, then corrected himself. "Se√±ora Mitchell, please tell the court what you discovered about Elena Herrera's disappearance."

Sarah took a deep breath and began recounting the investigation that had consumed her past weeks. The hidden journal, the plant smuggling operation, David Herrera's betrayal of his own family.

"Elena Herrera was a guardian," she said clearly. "She discovered that rare endemic plants were being stolen from protected areas and sold illegally. When she threatened to expose the operation, she was silenced."

David Herrera sat at the defendant's table, his expensive suit no longer a shield against the truth. Klaus Weber was in a separate trial, but the evidence Elena had gathered would convict them both.

## Scene 2

After the testimony, Sarah returned to Casa Vista Verde to find the inn full of supporters. The entire community had come to show their gratitude.

"You gave Elena a voice when she could no longer speak," Rosa Herrera said through tears. "You gave our family justice."

Carmen raised a glass of local wine. "To Sarah Mitchell, who came to La Palma seeking peace and instead became its protector."

As the sun set over the Atlantic, painting the volcanic peaks in shades of purple and gold, Sarah knew she had found more than she'd ever sought. Not just a new home, but a purpose, a community, a reason to continue.

The English detective had become La Palma's guardian of truth, and the island had given her a second chance at life.
