```

## When Planning Transition

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis
1. **Assess completion quality**:
   ``python
   # Load book completion data
   completion_data = Read(".claude/data/projects/{project}/book_{N}/completed.json")
   
   quality_factors = {
       'quality_score': completion_data['final_quality'],
       'completion_time': completion_data['duration_days'],
       'revision_rounds': completion_data.get('revisions', 0),
       'consistency_rating': completion_data['consistency_score']
   }
   
   # Determine publication readiness
   pub_ready = (
       quality_factors['quality_score'] >= 95 and
       quality_factors['consistency_rating'] >= 90
   )
```

2. **Analyze series position**:
   ``python
   # Load series progress
   series_progress = Read(".claude/data/projects/{project}/series_progress.json")
   
   series_factors = {
       'books_completed': series_progress['books_completed'],
       'books_remaining': series_progress['books_planned'] - series_progress['books_completed'],
       'series_momentum': series_progress['writing_velocity'],
       'arc_position': determine_arc_position(series_progress)
   }
   
   # Check continuation viability
   continue_viable = (
       series_factors['books_remaining'] > 0 and
       series_factors['series_momentum'] > 0.1  # books/month
   )
```

### Phase 2: Opportunity Identification
1. **Evaluate creative opportunities**:
   ``python
   # Analyze unresolved elements
   plot_threads = Read(".claude/data/projects/{project}/book_{N}/plot_threads.json")
   
   creative_opportunities = {
       'unresolved_mysteries': count_open_mysteries(plot_threads),
       'character_growth_potential': assess_character_arcs_remaining(),
       'world_exploration': identify_unexplored_areas(),
       'thematic_depth': find_unexplored_themes()
   }
   
   # Score continuation potential
   continuation_score = calculate_opportunity_score(creative_opportunities)
```

2. **Market timing assessment**:
   ``python
   market_factors = {
       'genre_trending': assess_genre_market(),
       'seasonal_timing': check_publication_calendar(),
       'competition_analysis': analyze_similar_releases(),
       'platform_readiness': check_author_platform_status()
   }
   
   market_score = calculate_market_opportunity(market_factors)
```

### Phase 3: Strategy Generation
1. **Develop recommendations**:
   ``python
   recommendations = {
       'primary_path': None,
       'immediate_actions': [],
       'preparation_needed': [],
       'timeline': {}
   }
   
   # Decision tree for primary recommendation
   if continue_viable and continuation_score > 80:
       recommendations['primary_path'] = 'series_continuation'
       recommendations['immediate_actions'] = [
           "Run /novel:next-book to start next book",
           "Review series bible for continuity",
           "Develop next book outline"
       ]
   elif pub_ready and market_score > 70:
       recommendations['primary_path'] = 'publication_pursuit'
       recommendations['immediate_actions'] = [
           "Prepare query letter",
           "Create synopsis",
           "Research agents/publishers"
       ]
   else:
       recommendations['primary_path'] = 'quality_enhancement'
       recommendations['immediate_actions'] = [
           "Commission professional edit",
           "Gather beta reader feedback",
           "Revise based on feedback"
       ]
```

2. **Create transition timeline**:
   ``python
   timeline = create_transition_timeline(
       primary_path=recommendations['primary_path'],
       current_date=datetime.now(),
       author_pace=series_factors['series_momentum']
   )
   
   recommendations['timeline'] = {
       'week_1': timeline['immediate'],
       'month_1': timeline['short_term'],
       'quarter_1': timeline['medium_term'],
       'year_1': timeline['long_term']
   }
```

### Phase 4: Report Generation
1. **Format recommendations**:
   ``markdown
   # Transition Plan
   
   ## Recommended Path: [Primary Path]
   
   Based on your book's quality score of [X]% and series position 
   ([Y] of [Z] books), the optimal next step is [primary_path].
   
   ## Immediate Actions (This Week)
   1. [Action 1]
   2. [Action 2]
   3. [Action 3]
   
   ## 30-Day Roadmap
   - Week 1: [Objectives]
   - Week 2: [Objectives]
   - Week 3: [Objectives]
   - Week 4: [Objectives]
   
   ## Success Metrics
   - [Metric 1]: [Target]
   - [Metric 2]: [Target]
   - [Metric 3]: [Target]
```
