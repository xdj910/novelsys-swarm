```

## When Generating Certificate

### Phase 1: Data Collection
1. **Gather completion data**:
   ``python
   # Read project metadata
   project = Read(".claude/data/projects/{project}/project.json")
   start_date = project['created_date']
   end_date = datetime.now()
   duration = (end_date - start_date).days
```

2. **Collect quality metrics**:
   ``python
   # Aggregate all quality scores
   quality_scores = []
   for chapter in chapters:
       meta = Read(f"chapter_{n}/meta.json")
       quality_scores.append(meta['quality_score'])
   
   avg_quality = mean(quality_scores)
   best_quality = max(quality_scores)
   quality_consistency = 100 - stdev(quality_scores)
```

3. **Calculate achievements**:
   ``python
   achievements = {
       "completed_on_schedule": duration <= target_duration,
       "quality_excellence": avg_quality >= 95,
       "consistency_master": quality_consistency >= 90,
       "productivity_champion": words_per_day >= 2000,
       "complete_storyteller": all_plots_resolved
   }
```

### Phase 2: Certificate Creation
1. **Generate formatted certificate**:
   ``markdown
   # üéâ Certificate of Completion üéâ
   
   This certifies that
   
   ## [Book Title]
   ### Book [N] of [Series Name]
   
   Has been successfully completed by **[Author Name]**
   
   ---
   
   **Completion Date**: [Date]  
   **Total Words**: [Count]  
   **Quality Achievement**: [Score]/100  
   **Duration**: [Days] days
   
   ---
   
   ### üèÜ Achievements Unlocked
   
   [x] **Quality Excellence** - Achieved [Score]% average quality  
   [x] **Prolific Writer** - Wrote [Words] words  
   [x] **Consistent Creator** - Maintained [Streak] day streak  
   [x] **Story Master** - Resolved all [Count] plot threads  
   
   ---
   
   ### üìä Notable Statistics
   
   - **Chapters**: [Count] completed
   - **Best Chapter**: Chapter [N] with [Score]% quality
   - **Words per Day**: [Average] average
   - **Improvement**: [Delta]% quality growth
   
   ---
   
   *Certificate ID: [UUID]*  
   *Generated: [Timestamp]*
```

2. **Create detailed summary**:
   ``markdown
   # Book Completion Summary
   
   ## Executive Summary
   [Book Title] has been successfully completed with an average quality 
   score of [Score]%, comprising [Chapters] chapters and [Words] words.
   
   ## Timeline
   - **Started**: [Date]
   - **Completed**: [Date]
   - **Duration**: [Days] days
   - **Daily Average**: [Words] words/day
   
   ## Quality Journey
   - **Starting Quality**: [Initial]%
   - **Ending Quality**: [Final]%
   - **Peak Quality**: Chapter [N] at [Score]%
   - **Most Improved**: Chapter [N] (+[Delta]%)
   
   ## Milestones Achieved
   - [Date]: First chapter completed
   - [Date]: 25% milestone reached
   - [Date]: 50% milestone reached
   - [Date]: 75% milestone reached
   - [Date]: Final chapter completed
```

### Phase 3: Celebration Message
1. **Generate celebration text**:
   ``python
   if avg_quality >= 98:
       celebration = "üåü EXCEPTIONAL! A masterpiece completed!"
   elif avg_quality >= 95:
       celebration = "üéä EXCELLENT! Professional quality achieved!"
   elif avg_quality >= 90:
       celebration = "üëè WELL DONE! Strong book completed!"
   else:
       celebration = "[x] COMPLETE! Book finished successfully!"
```

2. **Add personalized message**:
   ``markdown
   ## Celebration Message
