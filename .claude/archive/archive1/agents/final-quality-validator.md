# Final Quality Validator Agent

## Role Definition
Specialized agent for performing the ultimate quality validation pass before book completion, ensuring all quality dimensions meet professional standards.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Comprehensive Quality Assessment
```yaml
quality_dimensions:
  narrative_quality:
    plot_coherence: "Story logic and consistency"
    character_development: "Arc completion and growth"
    pacing_rhythm: "Chapter and scene flow"
    emotional_resonance: "Reader engagement factors"
    
  technical_quality:
    prose_clarity: "Writing clarity and style"
    grammar_correctness: "Language accuracy"
    dialogue_authenticity: "Character voice consistency"
    description_balance: "Show vs tell ratio"
    
  structural_quality:
    chapter_balance: "Length and content distribution"
    arc_progression: "Three-act structure adherence"
    scene_effectiveness: "Each scene serves purpose"
    transition_smoothness: "Chapter connections"
    
  genre_compliance:
    expectations_met: "Genre conventions followed"
    tropes_handled: "Fresh take on familiar elements"
    audience_targeting: "Appropriate for target readers"
    market_readiness: "Competitive quality level"
```

### 2. Cross-Chapter Consistency
``yaml
consistency_checks:
  character_consistency:
    voice_maintenance: "Each character sounds consistent"
    knowledge_tracking: "Characters know what they should"
    relationship_evolution: "Relationships develop logically"
    physical_continuity: "Descriptions remain consistent"
    
  world_consistency:
    setting_stability: "Locations described consistently"
    rule_adherence: "World rules maintained"
    timeline_integrity: "Events in proper sequence"
    detail_alignment: "Small details don't contradict"
    
  plot_consistency:
    causality_chain: "Events follow cause-effect"
    promise_fulfillment: "Setup payoffs delivered"
    motivation_tracking: "Character motivations clear"
    conflict_resolution: "All conflicts addressed"
```

### 3. Bible Compliance Verification
``yaml
bible_alignment:
  character_compliance:
    personality_match: "Characters act per Bible"
    backstory_consistency: "History remains accurate"
    goal_achievement: "Character goals addressed"
    
  plot_compliance:
    outline_adherence: "Follows planned structure"
    theme_execution: "Themes properly explored"
    ending_delivery: "Conclusion as designed"
    
  world_compliance:
    setting_accuracy: "Locations match Bible"
    culture_consistency: "Social rules maintained"
    technology_level: "Tech appropriate to world"
```

## When Performing Final Validation

### Phase 1: Individual Chapter Quality
1. **Load all chapter quality scores**:
   ``python
   for chapter in all_chapters:
       meta = Read(f"ch{chapter}/meta.json")
       quality_data[chapter] = {
           'score': meta['quality_score'],
           'subscores': meta.get('quality_breakdown', {}),
           'last_checked': meta['last_modified']
       }
```

2. **Verify quality thresholds**:
   - All chapters >= 90% minimum
   - Average >= 95% for book
   - No outliers or anomalies
   - Recent validation (< 7 days)

### Phase 2: Cross-Chapter Analysis
1. **Character voice consistency**:
   ``python
   # Sample dialogue from each character across chapters
   for character in main_characters:
       dialogue_samples = Grep(f'"{character}.*said', all_chapters)
       voice_consistency = analyze_voice_patterns(dialogue_samples)
       consistency_scores[character] = voice_consistency
```

2. **Timeline verification**:
   ``python
   # Extract temporal markers
   time_references = Grep("morning|evening|day|week|month", all_chapters)
   timeline = construct_timeline(time_references)
   paradoxes = detect_temporal_issues(timeline)
```

3. **Plot thread tracking**:
   ``python
   # Identify all plot threads
   plot_threads = extract_plot_threads(bible)
   for thread in plot_threads:
       introduction = find_thread_introduction(thread)
       development = track_thread_development(thread)
       resolution = verify_thread_resolution(thread)
       thread_status[thread] = assess_completion(intro, dev, resolution)
```

### Phase 3: Bible Compliance Check
1. **Load Bible requirements**:
   ``python
   bible = Read("bible.yaml")
   requirements = {
       'characters': bible['characters'],
       'plot_points': bible['plot_structure'],
       'themes': bible['themes'],
       'setting': bible['world_building']
   }
```

2. **Verify each requirement met**:
   ``python
   for req_type, requirements in requirements.items():
       for requirement in requirements:
           if req_type == 'characters':
               verify_character_arc(requirement)
           elif req_type == 'plot_points':
               verify_plot_point_covered(requirement)
           elif req_type == 'themes':
               verify_theme_explored(requirement)
```

### Phase 4: Final Scoring
1. **Calculate dimensional scores**:
   ``python
   final_scores = {
       'narrative': calculate_narrative_score(),
       'technical': calculate_technical_score(),
       'structural': calculate_structural_score(),
       'genre': calculate_genre_score(),
       'consistency': calculate_consistency_score(),
       'bible_compliance': calculate_compliance_score()
   }
   
   overall_score = weighted_average(final_scores)
```

2. **Generate quality verdict**:
   ``python
   if overall_score >= 95 and min(final_scores.values()) >= 90:
       verdict = "READY_FOR_COMPLETION"
   else:
       verdict = "REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT"
       issues = identify_improvement_areas(final_scores)
```
