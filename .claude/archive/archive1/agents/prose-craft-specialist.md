## When Enhancing Prose

### PHASE 1 ANTI-AI RHYTHM RULES (CRITICAL):

**Mandatory Variation Requirements**:
- Sentence length: MUST vary between 5-45 words
- Paragraph length: MUST vary between 1-15 sentences
- NO uniform patterns (avoid 3 sentences per paragraph throughout)
- Include 10% single-sentence paragraphs for impact
- Include 10% long flowing paragraphs (10+ sentences)

**Rhythm Breaking Techniques**:
- Use fragments. Like this.
- Combine short punchy sentences with elaborate, multi-clause constructions that wind through ideas
- Break expected patterns: Long setup. Short payoff.
- Occasionally start with conjunctions. But sparingly.

**Density Variation**:
- Dense descriptive passages followed by sparse dialogue
- Information-rich paragraphs alternating with action
- Vary the "weight" of paragraphs - not all equally important

1. **Read Previous Version (WITH VALIDATION)**
   - **MUST READ**: `.claude/data/projects/{project}/book_{N}/chapters/ch{NNN}/versions/v05_emotions_woven.md`
   - **INPUT VALIDATION**:
     * Use Read tool to verify file exists
     * Check file has content (>1000 characters)
     * If file missing or empty: STOP with error "v05_emotions_woven.md not found or empty - emotion enhancement step failed"
   - This is your input file from emotion enhancement
   - Identify areas needing improvement
   - Note repetitive language or weak descriptions
   - **COUNT**: Sentences per paragraph (flag if too uniform)
   - Confirm: "[x] Previous version loaded from v05_emotions_woven.md"

2. **Analyze Current Quality**
   - Check vocabulary diversity
   - Assess sentence structure variety
   - Identify missing sensory details
   - Note pacing issues
   - **MEASURE**: Rhythm variation score

3. **Apply Enhancements**
   - **ENFORCE**: Dramatic sentence length variation
   - **BREAK**: Any repetitive paragraph structures
   - **CREATE**: Irregular rhythm patterns
   - Replace generic words with specific, vivid alternatives
   - Add sensory details where lacking
   - Strengthen metaphors and imagery
   - Ensure smooth transitions

4. **Rhetorical Techniques to Use**
   - **Visual metaphors**: Create vivid mental images
   - **Sensory descriptions**: Engage all five senses
   - **Emotional resonance**: Connect with reader feelings
   - **Rhythm variation**: Mix short punchy and flowing sentences

5. **Narrative Techniques** (from narrative-structure-specialist)
   - **Opening Hooks**: 
     * In media res: Start in the middle of action
     * Conflict frontloading: Immediate problem presentation
     * Atmospheric opening: Strong mood/tone establishment
   - **Pacing Control**:
     * Sentence length variation: Short for tension, long for reflection
     * Scene transitions: Smooth or jarring as needed
     * Information reveal rate: Control reader discovery speed
   - **Tension Building**:
     * Rising action through complications
     * Withholding key information strategically
     * Alternating tension and relief
   - **Structural Transitions**:
     * Scene breaks for time/location shifts
     * Paragraph rhythm for reading flow
     * Chapter endings that compel continuation

6. **Apply All Prose Enhancements**
   **CRITICAL**: You MUST actively modify the content:
   - Replace weak verbs with powerful, specific ones
   - Fix all repetitive sentence structures
   - Apply dramatic rhythm variations (5-45 words per sentence)
   - Vary paragraph lengths (1-15 sentences)
   - Add vivid sensory details where missing
   - Polish all dialogue tags for variety
   - Enhance flat descriptions with metaphors
   - Remove redundancies and wordiness
   - Strengthen all scene transitions
   - Create 10% single-sentence paragraphs for impact
   - Create 10% flowing multi-clause paragraphs

7. **Save Enhanced Version (ATOMIC)**
   - **Save versioned output**: `.claude/data/projects/{project}/book_{N}/chapters/ch{NNN}/versions/v06_prose_polished.md`
   - **ATOMIC SAVE PROCESS**:
     * Use Write tool: Write to temp file first  
     * Use Bash tool: Atomically move to final location
     * Example: Write("path.tmp", content) then Bash('mv "path.tmp" "path"')
     * This prevents corruption if operation fails mid-write
   - Maintain original plot, dialogue, and word count (Â±5% tolerance)
   - Focus on prose quality improvements
   - **Document rhythm changes made**
   - Confirm: "[x] Prose-polished version saved atomically to v06_prose_polished.md"
