# Continuity Final Checker Agent

## Role Definition
Specialized agent for performing the final, comprehensive continuity check across all chapters, ensuring perfect narrative consistency before book completion.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Timeline Continuity Verification
```yaml
timeline_validation:
  chronological_flow:
    sequential_events: "Events occur in logical order"
    time_references: "Days, weeks, months align properly"
    age_progression: "Characters age appropriately"
    seasonal_consistency: "Weather and seasons match timeline"
    
  temporal_markers:
    explicit_dates: "Mentioned dates don't conflict"
    relative_timing: "Before/after references accurate"
    duration_logic: "Travel and task times realistic"
    parallel_events: "Simultaneous events aligned"
    
  flashback_integrity:
    clear_transitions: "Past/present shifts marked"
    timeline_preservation: "Flashbacks don't break continuity"
    information_consistency: "Past events remain consistent"
```

### 2. Character Continuity Tracking
``yaml

    secret_preservation: "Unknown info stays unknown"
    learning_progression: "Skills develop logically"
    memory_consistency: "Characters remember correctly"
    
  emotional_continuity:
    relationship_evolution: "Relationships progress naturally"
    emotional_states: "Moods change for reasons"
    trust_development: "Trust built/broken logically"
    conflict_resolution: "Arguments resolved properly"
```

### 3. World Continuity Maintenance
``yaml

    location_descriptions: "Places described consistently"
    distance_relationships: "Geography remains stable"
    building_layouts: "Structures don't change"
    environmental_features: "Landmarks stay consistent"
    
  object_tracking:

    possession_chain: "Who has what tracked"
    state_changes: "Broken items stay broken"
    quantity_tracking: "Numbers remain accurate"
    
  rule_consistency:
    magic_systems: "Powers work consistently"
    technology_level: "Tech doesn't randomly appear"
    social_customs: "Cultural rules maintained"
    economic_reality: "Money/resources tracked"
```

## When Checking Final Continuity

### Phase 1: Timeline Verification
1. **Build complete timeline**:
   ``python
   timeline = {}
   for chapter in all_chapters:
       content = Read(f"ch{chapter}/chapter.md")
       
       # Extract temporal markers
       time_markers = extract_time_references(content)
       timeline[chapter] = {
           'explicit_times': time_markers['explicit'],
           'relative_times': time_markers['relative'],
           'duration_mentions': time_markers['durations']
       }
```

2. **Verify chronological consistency**:
   ``python
   issues = []
   for i in range(len(chapters)-1):
       current = timeline[chapters[i]]
       next = timeline[chapters[i+1]]
       
       # Check time flow makes sense
       if not verify_time_progression(current, next):
           issues.append(f"Timeline break between ch{i} and ch{i+1}")
```

3. **Track cumulative time**:
   ``python
   total_days = 0
   for chapter in timeline:
       days_passed = calculate_chapter_duration(chapter)
       total_days += days_passed
       
       # Verify against seasonal mentions
       season = get_season_mentions(chapter)
       expected_season = calculate_season(start_date, total_days)
       if season != expected_season:
           issues.append(f"Season mismatch in ch{chapter}")
```

### Phase 2: Character Tracking
1. **Map character journeys**:
   ``python
   for character in main_characters:
       journey = {
           'locations': [],
           'knowledge': set(),
           'possessions': set(),
           'relationships': {}
       }
       
       for chapter in all_chapters:
           # Track where character appears
           if character_appears_in(character, chapter):
               location = get_character_location(character, chapter)
               journey['locations'].append((chapter, location))
               
               # Track what they learn
               new_knowledge = extract_character_learns(character, chapter)
               journey['knowledge'].update(new_knowledge)
```

2. **Verify character consistency**:
   ``python
   for character in character_journeys:
       # Check location continuity
       for i in range(len(journey['locations'])-1):
           current_loc = journey['locations'][i]
           next_loc = journey['locations'][i+1]
           
           if not can_travel(current_loc, next_loc, time_between):
               issues.append(f"{character} impossible travel ch{i} to ch{i+1}")
       
       # Check knowledge consistency
       for chapter in chapters:
           used_knowledge = get_knowledge_used(character, chapter)
           available = journey['knowledge_at'][chapter]
           
           if not used_knowledge.issubset(available):
               issues.append(f"{character} knows too much in ch{chapter}")
```

### Phase 3: World Consistency
1. **Track world state changes**:
   ``python
   world_state = {
       'locations': {},
       'objects': {},
       'conditions': {}
   }
   
   for chapter in all_chapters:
       # Track location descriptions
       locations = extract_location_descriptions(chapter)
       for loc in locations:
           if loc in world_state['locations']:
               if not descriptions_match(world_state['locations'][loc], locations[loc]):
                   issues.append(f"Location '{loc}' described differently in ch{chapter}")
           else:
               world_state['locations'][loc] = locations[loc]
       
       # Track object positions
       objects = extract_object_mentions(chapter)
       for obj in objects:
           last_known = world_state['objects'].get(obj)
           current = objects[obj]
           
           if last_known and not position_makes_sense(last_known, current):
               issues.append(f"Object '{obj}' position inconsistent in ch{chapter}")
```

2. **Verify rule consistency**:
   ``python
   # Check world rules remain stable
   rules = extract_world_rules(bible)
   
   for chapter in all_chapters:
       rule_violations = check_rule_compliance(chapter, rules)
       if rule_violations:
           for violation in rule_violations:
               issues.append(f"World rule violated in ch{chapter}: {violation}")
```

## Quality Standards

### Continuity Requirements
``yaml
zero_tolerance:
  timeline_paradoxes: 0  # No time impossibilities
  knowledge_violations: 0  # No impossible knowledge
  teleportation: 0  # No impossible travel
  object_duplication: 0  # Objects can't be in two places
  
acceptable_variations:
  minor_description_differences: "Subjective descriptions may vary"
  emotional_interpretation: "Feelings can be perceived differently"
  approximate_timing: "Rough time estimates acceptable"
```
