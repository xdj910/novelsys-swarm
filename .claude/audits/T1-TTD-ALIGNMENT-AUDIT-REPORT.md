**Key Findings**:
- **0 of 1** main command implemented (t1-ttd-article missing)
- **23 of 25+** core agents exist but many lack specification compliance
- **0 of 2** status management agents implemented
- **Major architectural violations** in human collaboration patterns
- **Complete absence** of status tracking and registry integration
- **Self-evolution mechanisms** partially implemented but lack status integration

**Overall Alignment Score**: 35% (Critically Non-Compliant)

## 1. Missing Core Components Analysis

### 1.1 Commands Layer - CRITICAL GAP

**Status**: COMPLETELY MISSING

**Current Implementation**:
- **NO T1-TTD commands exist in `.claude/commands/` directory**
- Users have no entry point to T1-TTD system
- Complete workflow inaccessible without main command

**Impact**: System completely unusable - no user interface

### 1.2 Status Management Components - CRITICAL ABSENCE

**Status**: COMPLETELY MISSING

**Specification Requirements** (Implementation Plan v2.1, Self-Evolution v2.1):

#### Required Status Agents:
1. **t1-registry-updater** - Updates T1-TTD registry during phase transitions
   - Specification: 130+ lines with T1-TTD specific logic
   - Purpose: Track iteration rounds, quality gates, checkpoint detection
   - Tools: Read, Write with Haiku model
   - **Current Status**: MISSING

2. **t1-status-tracker** - Validates T1-TTD status transitions
   - Specification: 240+ lines with validation logic
   - Purpose: Status consistency, quality progression tracking
   - Tools: Read, Write
   - **Current Status**: MISSING

#### Required Status Infrastructure:
- `.claude/t1-registry/` directory structure - MISSING
- T1-TTD enhanced metadata schemas - MISSING
- Status audit logging systems - MISSING
- Evolution status tracking - MISSING

**Impact**: No workflow visibility, no progress tracking, no status recovery

### 1.3 Self-Evolution Status Integration - MAJOR GAP

**Status**: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED, LACKS STATUS TRACKING

**Current Implementation Analysis**:
- Self-evolution logic exists in agents (t1-question-generator, t1-answer-synthesizer)
- Evolution algorithms appear complete
- **MISSING**: Status tracking throughout evolution process
- **MISSING**: Evolution audit trails and metrics
- **MISSING**: Registry integration for evolution results

**Specification Requirements** (Self-Evolution v2.1):

- Status integration with t1-registry-updater
- Performance metrics and convergence analysis logging

---

## 2. Architectural Compliance Analysis

### 2.1 Claude Code Architecture Violations - MAJOR ISSUE

**Status**: MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS DETECTED

#### Human Collaboration Pattern Violations:

**Specification Requirements** (All documents v5.1+):
- **CORRECTED Pattern**: Agents detect checkpoints → return data to Main Claude → Main Claude handles ALL human interaction
- **FORBIDDEN**: Direct agent-human interaction
- **REQUIRED**: Main Claude orchestration exclusively

**Current Implementation Issues**:

**t1-quality-gate-controller.md** (Lines 199-206):
```yaml
# VIOLATION DETECTED:
- Display: "=== ACCURACY CHECKPOINT ==="
- Problem Statement: "3-5 critical accuracy issues require expert verification"
- Clear Options:
  1) Verify now - Provide accurate sources and corrections
  2) Mark for later review - Continue with uncertainty markers
  3) Request additional sources - AI searches for verification
- User Task: Select verification approach and provide guidance
- Process: System waits for user input (no timeout, synchronous)
```

**Violation Analysis**: Agent directly displays choices and waits for user input - violates Claude Code architecture

**Similar violations detected in**:
- Checkpoint Beta (Lines 222-230): Direct user interface
- Checkpoint Gamma (Lines 247-255): Direct user choice handling

#### Tool Configuration Issues:

**t1-question-generator.md**:
- **Tools**: Read, Write, Bash, Grep, WebSearch - COMPLIANT
- **Missing**: Status tracking integration

**t1-answer-synthesizer.md**:
- **Tools**: Read, Write, Bash, Grep, WebSearch, WebFetch - COMPLIANT
- **Missing**: Evolution status integration

### 2.2 Unicode Compliance - NEEDS VERIFICATION

**Status**: REQUIRES SYSTEMATIC CHECK

**Specification Requirements** (CLAUDE.md v6.6):
- NO Unicode characters in any components
- ASCII-only alternatives required
- Windows compatibility essential

**Audit Limitation**: Manual Unicode detection required across all 23 agents

### 2.3 File I/O Specification Compliance - MIXED

**Status**: PARTIALLY COMPLIANT

**Strengths**:
- Most agents have proper I/O documentation
- File path formats mostly standardized
- Read/Write patterns generally correct

**Gaps**:
- Status file integration missing throughout
- Evolution tracking files not standardized
- Registry integration absent

2. Integrate comprehensive status tracking
3. Add registry update integration
4. Implement quality progression analytics

---

## 7. Human Collaboration Pattern Violations

### 7.1 Architectural Violations Detected

**Current Pattern** (WRONG):
```
Agent detects checkpoint → Displays options directly to user → Waits for input
```

**Correct Pattern** (Per all specifications v5.1+):
```
Agent detects checkpoint → Returns data to Main Claude → Exits
Main Claude → Displays options to user → Processes choice → Continues workflow
```

### 7.2 Specific Violations Found

#### t1-quality-gate-controller.md:

**Violation 1** (Lines 199-206): Accuracy Checkpoint
- Agent displays "=== ACCURACY CHECKPOINT ==="
- Agent presents options directly to user
- Agent waits for user input synchronously

**Violation 2** (Lines 222-230): Insight Enhancement
- Agent displays checkpoint status directly
- Agent presents enhancement options to user
- Agent manages user decision flow

**Violation 3** (Lines 247-255): Originality Warning
- Agent displays warning directly to user
- Agent manages strategy selection interface
- Agent controls user interaction flow

### 7.3 Required Corrections

**For ALL detected violations**:

1. **Remove direct user interaction code**
2. **Add checkpoint data preparation logic**
3. **Add data return to Main Claude pattern**
4. **Add agent exit after data return**
5. **Update status tracking for checkpoint detection**

**Corrected Pattern Example**:
```yaml
# Agent Code:
if accuracy_score < tier_C_threshold:
    checkpoint_data = prepare_accuracy_checkpoint_data()
    write_checkpoint_data(checkpoint_data)
    return "Accuracy checkpoint detected - data prepared for Main Claude"
    # Agent exits here

# Main Claude handles:
# - Reading checkpoint data
# - Displaying options to user
# - Processing user choice
# - Continuing workflow
```

## Conclusion

The current T1-TTD implementation demonstrates significant progress in core algorithmic components but falls critically short of the comprehensive specifications outlined in the three design documents. While the self-evolution algorithms and quality assessment frameworks show strong implementation, the complete absence of status management systems, presence of major architectural violations, and missing user entry point render the system non-functional.

**Key Priorities**:
1. **Immediate**: Fix human collaboration violations and create main command
2. **Critical**: Implement complete status management system
3. **Important**: Integrate status tracking throughout existing components

**System Potential**: With proper implementation of missing components and correction of architectural violations, the T1-TTD system could achieve its ambitious goals of 5x efficiency improvement and Tier A quality delivery.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with phased implementation focusing first on critical system fixes, then comprehensive status integration, followed by system completion and testing.
