## Task 2: Fix Human Collaboration Violations ✅

### Implementation Details
**File Modified**: `.claude/agents/t1-quality-gate-controller.md`
**Lines Changed**: 199-255 (corrected collaboration framework)
**Violation Type**: Agent-human direct interaction (architecture violation)

### Critical Fixes Applied

#### BEFORE (Violation Pattern):
```yaml
Agent Role:
- Display: "=== ACCURACY CHECKPOINT ==="
- User Task: Select verification approach and provide guidance
- Process: System waits for user input (no timeout, synchronous)
```

#### AFTER (Corrected Architecture):
```yaml
Agent Role: Detect checkpoint condition and prepare data
1. Detect accuracy threshold breach
2. Prepare checkpoint data with specific problems and recommendations
3. Return checkpoint data to Main Claude
4. Exit agent execution

Main Claude Role: Handle ALL human interaction
1. Display checkpoint data from agent
2. Present options with numerical choices
3. Process user choice
4. Apply verification decisions
5. Continue workflow
```

### Checkpoints Corrected
1. **Checkpoint Alpha (Accuracy)**: Agent detects → prepares data → returns to Main Claude
2. **Checkpoint Beta (Insight)**: Agent detects → prepares suggestions → returns to Main Claude
3. **Checkpoint Gamma (Originality)**: Agent detects → prepares recommendations → returns to Main Claude

### Architecture Compliance Validation
- ✅ No direct agent-human interaction
- ✅ All human interaction handled by Main Claude
- ✅ Proper detect → return → exit pattern
- ✅ Numerical choice format (1/2/3)
- ✅ Complete audit trail maintenance
